[5690ms - 9160ms] Did you think that against Prince Julius...
[30340ms - 32270ms] This is all for the greater good.
[32270ms - 35920ms] Don't take it personally, Prince Julius!
[47940ms - 50150ms] Very impressive, Prince Julius.
[52040ms - 56200ms] Even when you break your wrist,  you heal it immediately with a spell.
[57130ms - 60450ms] You do indeed have  the advantage in close combat.
[61720ms - 64460ms] Acceleration: Three Burst.
[65870ms - 67960ms] He predicted it?
[73570ms - 74790ms] What the hell?
[74790ms - 78570ms] Her prince abandoned her  and even attacked her, and yet...
[80560ms - 83020ms] I want you in greater despair!
[83470ms - 86010ms] You really are a heartless woman.
[86010ms - 89070ms] You actually punched  your own kingdom's prince!
[91020ms - 94120ms] It's awful to hear you say I'm heartless.
[95380ms - 97820ms] This is proof of true love...
[97820ms - 103220ms] The fists of love that won't stop until  Prince Julius is back in his right mind!
[115390ms - 120930ms] I hate people who look down on me  because they're life's winners.
[121490ms - 123390ms] Always enjoying themselves...
[129120ms - 130530ms] Sorry!
[131740ms - 136830ms] Like they never act petty  or think awful things.
[137870ms - 139410ms] I...
[141290ms - 144620ms] I want to see them in despair.
[145230ms - 148880ms] I want their faces distorted with agony.
[149590ms - 152890ms] Still, this isn't like you.
[154760ms - 157720ms] To fall straight into the enemy's trap...
[158190ms - 161830ms] Fireball, blaze with an inferno's rage.
[169140ms - 173230ms] Or is it that you prefer  women like Terenezza?
[173230ms - 174700ms] Jealous?
[174700ms - 180660ms] It's rather charming to see you  act like a lady your age for once.
[183670ms - 186460ms] Stop flirting already.
[193110ms - 198290ms] Do you not realize the situation you're in?
[207100ms - 209310ms] That's a good look on you, Scarlet.
[209700ms - 212690ms] I should have just done this from the start!
[214270ms - 216700ms] I can see your blessing exhausting itself.
[216700ms - 219240ms] It's really weak now!
[219240ms - 224180ms] In that state, you won't  be able to stop my lance.
[225660ms - 228620ms] If you don't want to see  your precious prince killed,
[228620ms - 230500ms] surrender where you stand!
[232440ms - 234040ms] Very well.
[234040ms - 235550ms] I admit defeat.
[237860ms - 240590ms] Link your hands behind your head.
[244310ms - 249270ms] This spell will steal  your blessings from you.
[250980ms - 253800ms] Blessings given directly by gods
[253800ms - 258350ms] can only be stolen with this special  spell that uses Palmia's power.
[258720ms - 265450ms] But if I steal your blessings,  I can achieve Palmia's goal with ease.
[265980ms - 270670ms] This spell has the power to prevent  a blessing from activating.
[270670ms - 273360ms] There's no way around this.
[273360ms - 276130ms] Julius, restrain her.
[288850ms - 293040ms] What inappropriate nonsense is this?
[293040ms - 295090ms] I'm restraining you.
[295090ms - 297150ms] Blame Terenezza, not me.
[297150ms - 300070ms] Seems my charm's effect is waning.
[300070ms - 304580ms] How truly vexing that blessing  of yours, Heroic Tale, is.
[304580ms - 306080ms] Heroic Tale?
[307410ms - 309230ms] You didn't know?
[309230ms - 312190ms] Well, it'll be mine soon enough.
[312190ms - 316050ms] I just know what Palmia told me,  but since this is almost over, I'll tell you.
[316050ms - 322680ms] Heroic Tale is a special blessing created by  Origin the Creator, the god above all others.
[322680ms - 328810ms] It allows the wielder  to unleash unlimited power
[328810ms - 331100ms] when the person they love is in danger.
[331470ms - 333190ms] The person they love?
[334690ms - 339280ms] No, I don't feel that way  about you whatsoever.
[343090ms - 345920ms] You deny it so earnestly...
[346360ms - 349620ms] But then why is the blessing  going into effect?
[349880ms - 352460ms] It's quite annoying, you know.
[352930ms - 358540ms] The way you toy with my feelings  with those suggestive acts of yours...
[359050ms - 363580ms] I don't have any of those feelings  for you, either.
[365890ms - 368430ms] Yes. That's right.
[369420ms - 371620ms] She really is cold!
[371620ms - 375020ms] Such an awful thing to say  to the person who threw himself on you
[375020ms - 376910ms] to protect you from Godwin's shot!
[378360ms - 380190ms] I like it, though.
[380190ms - 386320ms] Heroic Tale can't activate fully  unless the love is mutual.
[388290ms - 389630ms] That time back then, too...
[390450ms - 394040ms] Was that also the effect of  Origin the Creator's blessing?
[394700ms - 398310ms] Then the reason Julius almost died...
[401050ms - 404510ms] The reason he's doing what  that filthy woman says...
[404510ms - 408180ms] I guess it was always a one-sided love!
[408180ms - 409720ms] So funny!
[409990ms - 414420ms] It was all my fault? Because I didn't...
[414420ms - 417000ms] You really are a villainess!
[417000ms - 420650ms] You can never become a true leading lady!
[420980ms - 424860ms] Prince Julius.  Allow me to confirm one thing.
[424860ms - 426170ms] Yes?
[426170ms - 431970ms] If your blessing activates fully,  you'll be able to overcome all dangers
[431970ms - 434290ms] and save me?
[434920ms - 438450ms] Even under the influence  of the charm blessing...
[438450ms - 440710ms] Why are you asking me that?
[442280ms - 447850ms] Neither of us is in love with the other.
[448340ms - 451050ms] Well? Tell me clearly!
[456460ms - 457300ms] Yes.
[457910ms - 461540ms] Heroic Tale grants the power  to overcome all dangers
[461540ms - 464530ms] so I can save the one I love.
[465710ms - 468200ms] That's quite a relief.
[474060ms - 476410ms] Save me, Prince Julius.
[502670ms - 504440ms] It's finally broken.
[504440ms - 507390ms] Heroic Tale has activated completely?!
[509600ms - 516120ms] When you said you didn't feel that way  about me, you had me rather worried.
[520850ms - 521580ms] Huh?
[521580ms - 523830ms] I beg your pardon?
[523830ms - 527760ms] Do you know how much I struggled with  myself to work up the courage to say that?
[527760ms - 529550ms] You did well, though.
[529550ms - 532090ms] You can leave the rest to me.
[534790ms - 537270ms] Screw your Heroic Tale...
[539310ms - 544570ms] That nonsense doesn't stand  a chance against my divine vessel!
[544980ms - 545650ms] It's pointless.
[547780ms - 550400ms] Hit him! Just hit him!
[550730ms - 553890ms] Your divine vessel can't emit  anything more than a gentle breeze.
[553890ms - 558330ms] That gutless goddess Palmia  has a cruel sense of humor.
[558330ms - 560960ms] You don't get to say that!
[568910ms - 569840ms] You...
[570420ms - 571730ms] Die!
[572500ms - 575450ms] Quite a live wire you are.
[575450ms - 579310ms] You're smiling, black-hearted prince.
[579310ms - 580450ms] Why...
[580880ms - 582580ms] Why?!
[582580ms - 585790ms] Why won't anything go the way I want?!
[586480ms - 588680ms] I'm the leading lady!
[588680ms - 591570ms] I'm the main character!  Everyone's supposed to love me!
[593180ms - 597670ms] Everyone who doesn't  love me should just die!
[597670ms - 600440ms] The whole kingdom... the whole world...
[600790ms - 603450ms] should just disappear!
[608670ms - 612340ms] You show yourself at last,  you piece of shit goddess.
[613050ms - 617130ms] Don't worry, my darling Terenezza.
[617510ms - 620970ms] You have me to love you.
[638920ms - 644540ms] Now, show those villains  who try to get in your way
[644980ms - 648000ms] the true power of a leading lady!
[648880ms - 652700ms] Light of love, rain down.
[657120ms - 658140ms] What the...
[658140ms - 659240ms] Hey!
[659600ms - 661520ms] The ceiling's coming down!
[663140ms - 664960ms] Saint Protective Barrier!
[671070ms - 674650ms] I'll protect them all!
[680900ms - 684720ms] That would have fried us  if it had hit head-on.
[684720ms - 686630ms] Incredible power.
[686630ms - 691430ms] Yet your blessing, Heroic Tale,  nullified it entirely.
[691430ms - 692870ms] Quite impressive.
[693370ms - 696550ms] But she seems to have used too much power.
[698340ms - 702140ms] I believe it may be time  for us to strike back.
[702140ms - 703930ms] I believe it worked like this...
[703930ms - 706660ms] Light of love, rain down.
[711480ms - 713860ms] Would you like another helping of my fists?
[719930ms - 722910ms] She's regenerating as soon as she's injured...
[723230ms - 725870ms] Those necklaces don't even compare.
[726400ms - 729580ms] In other words, I can  punch her as much as I like?
[729870ms - 735140ms] No, I doubt the fun will last much longer.
[736130ms - 738400ms] As compatible as they may be,
[738400ms - 741650ms] a human vessel can't withstand  the power of a god for long.
[742120ms - 746280ms] Terenezza will die within minutes.
[747730ms - 751900ms] We have no way to finish her, so we  could wait for her to self-destruct...
[751900ms - 752690ms] I won't wait.
[753930ms - 756030ms] I won't let it end that way.
[758650ms - 760020ms] I refuse to.
[769750ms - 770960ms] Because...
[770960ms - 777920ms] I still haven't dealt her the blow  that will really make me feel better.
[778540ms - 780380ms] I thought you would say that.
[783670ms - 786130ms] I'll protect you with my blessing.
[786130ms - 790510ms] I'll make sure it holds out  until you can deliver that punch.
[794440ms - 796530ms] I won't say thank you.
[796870ms - 802400ms] I expect you to spend your life repaying me  for gifting you my maiden lips.
[805130ms - 806240ms] Go on, then.
[809830ms - 813170ms] Light of love, rain down.
[813440ms - 817420ms] Shine of the hero, protect my beloved.
[819080ms - 822630ms] If not... If not for you...
[822630ms - 826130ms] Scarlet!
[826130ms - 828860ms] Time, stop.
[830940ms - 832770ms] Time of Chronoir.
[837940ms - 840530ms] I shall now deliver...
[840530ms - 843950ms] the blow that will put all regrets to rest!
[844200ms - 845990ms] Go flying...
[853000ms - 855330ms] to the ends of the world!
[874900ms - 876900ms] I feel so much better now!
[882340ms - 883910ms] Blessing of Chronoa:
[884890ms - 886760ms] Saint Protective Barrier.
[895200ms - 897540ms] Did I do it?
[897540ms - 899420ms] Well done.
[899420ms - 901630ms] You carried out your duty perfectly...
[901990ms - 903330ms] Saint Sanya.
[905770ms - 906840ms] Yeah!
[921080ms - 924320ms] You're going to leave  without saying goodbye?
[924650ms - 927160ms] Prince Julius told me...
[927160ms - 930530ms] You've become an intelligence  agent for Pallistan, then?
[930930ms - 932660ms] Oh, well...
[932660ms - 936180ms] He said that if I didn't agree,  he'd sentence me to a hundred years
[936180ms - 939700ms] of hard labor in the boonies  with the other inquisitors!
[939700ms - 942780ms] It was basically a plea bargain!
[943250ms - 946880ms] There's no telling  when you'll return to Pallistan.
[949170ms - 950600ms] Dios!
[953290ms - 955020ms] I want to talk to you.
[955020ms - 957030ms] About us.
[958920ms - 962990ms] You heard that we were half-siblings, then?
[965800ms - 969360ms] You saved me in the western ruins that day.
[971310ms - 972490ms] Thank you.
[973200ms - 980270ms] In the past, I've only done my duties  as a saint because I was told to.
[980630ms - 984380ms] Because I thought it was  the only thing I was good for.
[985050ms - 985670ms] But...
[987420ms - 988880ms] Things will be different now.
[989230ms - 993490ms] I want to protect the people  of this country of my own will.
[993490ms - 998030ms] For the sake of this kingdom's future,  I want to carry out my mission
[998460ms - 1002860ms] with my divinely granted gift,  risking my life to fight like you all do.
[1003480ms - 1007520ms] Scarlet was right. Sanya is strong.
[1008240ms - 1009820ms] Look at you...
[1009820ms - 1012350ms] Acting all grown up, are we?!
[1012350ms - 1014030ms] Hey! What are you doing?!
[1014030ms - 1018830ms] By the way, I told everyone that you only  betrayed them because I manipulated you.
[1018830ms - 1021240ms] Huh? But it was my own weakness that—
[1021240ms - 1026170ms] And anyway, the info you gave me  turned out to be meaningless!
[1027380ms - 1032410ms] I mean, when you told me with a straight face  about the taste of the bread you order,
[1032410ms - 1035100ms] it was all I could do to keep from laughing.
[1037320ms - 1041770ms] D-Dios!
[1043010ms - 1045000ms] Well, goodbye!
[1045000ms - 1048720ms] Next time we meet,  let's have ourselves a date, Scarlet!
[1049430ms - 1052450ms] Stupid Dios! Don't hit on my sister!
[1052450ms - 1054140ms] Farewell!
[1054140ms - 1055870ms] Never come back,
[1055870ms - 1058990ms] you lying elf!
[1062650ms - 1068290ms] If things go as planned, we should make it  well in time for Julius's tea party.
[1068290ms - 1070440ms] I believe it's to celebrate our contributions.
[1070440ms - 1074180ms] Saint Diana, Sir Sigurd, and the members  of the Holy Order will also attend.
[1074180ms - 1075180ms] Yes.
[1075180ms - 1079440ms] Once Terenezza was off the board,  the Eldrand Army withdrew immediately.
[1079900ms - 1082030ms] Things have finally been resolved.
[1082660ms - 1086450ms] But I fear how capable that man is.
[1087490ms - 1090740ms] He used the fact that he was  also controlled by her charms
[1090740ms - 1094990ms] as testimony to condemn  Sargon and the other Palmians.
[1096080ms - 1102670ms] In that moment, the Palmians saw clearly  that Diana was not a false saint,
[1103250ms - 1109320ms] and began to insist that they had been  brainwashed by the Saint of Palmia.
[1109920ms - 1113400ms] As a result, the Palmian religion  has been dissolved.
[1114000ms - 1118640ms] My brother, did you know  about Prince Julius's blessing?
[1118640ms - 1121720ms] I knew he had a blessing,
[1122080ms - 1123720ms] but for some reason he said...
[1124460ms - 1128190ms] I could never speak of something  so embarrassing in public.
[1128190ms - 1131150ms] ...and kept it strictly to himself.
[1131550ms - 1136040ms] Even if he'd told me, though,  I'm not sure I would have believed it.
[1136040ms - 1140370ms] I don't even know how much of this he planned.
[1140690ms - 1144110ms] Indeed, how much did he plan?
[1145330ms - 1146080ms] Oh.
[1146080ms - 1147510ms] What is it, Scarlet?
[1147510ms - 1149040ms] You aren't feeling well?
[1150950ms - 1152960ms] He beat me.
[1155190ms - 1158650ms] He arranged a situation  in which I would be in danger
[1158650ms - 1162890ms] and have to rely on his power,
[1162890ms - 1166740ms] made me confess my feelings and kiss him...
[1166740ms - 1171110ms] In other words, to unlock his hidden power,
[1171110ms - 1173920ms] he intentionally let himself be charmed.
[1174320ms - 1176470ms] What are you muttering about?
[1177110ms - 1178280ms] Brother.
[1178280ms - 1180840ms] I have business to take care of.
[1182450ms - 1185330ms] I'll go ahead of you with Rex.
[1194420ms - 1196180ms] Such cute desserts!
[1196180ms - 1198050ms] Is this apple pie?
[1198050ms - 1200140ms] Scarlet's favorite.
[1200140ms - 1203430ms] We made a promise to have some  when this was all over.
[1211300ms - 1212780ms] Good day to you...
[1213270ms - 1214970ms] Prince Julius.
[1215360ms - 1218610ms] Perfect timing, Scarlet.
[1218610ms - 1222450ms] Your apple pie with vanilla  ice cream was just finished.
[1223030ms - 1225990ms] No, it is not yet finished.
[1225990ms - 1230120ms] It's lacking a dash of mortal peril, you see.
[1230120ms - 1232750ms] It seems you have something to say.
[1232750ms - 1233930ms] Yes.
[1233930ms - 1238720ms] Kindly brace yourself  so that I may enlighten you.
[1238720ms - 1240930ms] Ah, of course.
[1240930ms - 1244180ms] First, may I ask you one thing?
[1244180ms - 1245770ms] What is it?
[1246400ms - 1251730ms] When you kiss someone, you should be sure  to tilt your head just a little bit.
[1251730ms - 1253820ms] You don't want to bump noses.
[1253820ms - 1257670ms] Also, it's not good to dive in too quickly.
[1257670ms - 1259580ms] It hurts when your teeth clack together.
[1260150ms - 1264650ms] Next time we do it, I hope you'll  take these things into account.
[1265140ms - 1266240ms] Understand?
[1266240ms - 1268690ms] My beloved Lady of Beatings.
[1269450ms - 1272660ms] First, you said it was just one thing,
[1272660ms - 1276910ms] but you ended up making  two different requests.
[1276910ms - 1278670ms] Yes, I did!
