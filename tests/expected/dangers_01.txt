[4980ms - 8490ms] I'm messed up in the head.
[10530ms - 13200ms] No one at this junior high realizes
[13620ms - 15750ms] how the peaceful equilibrium of daily life
[15330ms - 18120ms] You whacked off with a toilet paper roll?!
[15750ms - 17460ms] teeters on the edge.
[19250ms - 20210ms] Dude, I can't believe it!
[22380ms - 24130ms] Try it out, man.
[24130ms - 25960ms] Maybe I'll give it a go, eh?
[26670ms - 27670ms] Wonder if it'll fit?
[27670ms - 30720ms] But man, what I'd give for a titjob!
[34680ms - 36720ms] No! Stop thinking about it!
[37270ms - 39690ms] I'm a bloodthirsty beast.
[39980ms - 41940ms] When will the day come?
[41940ms - 44730ms] When will I overcome these urges?
[48110ms - 51240ms] There's the girl I want to kill most of all.
[51240ms - 53200ms] Yamada Anna.
[53200ms - 57200ms] The prettiest girl in school, and a magazine model, apparently.
[57200ms - 59330ms] But I don't give a damn.
[59330ms - 64840ms] All I want is to see that beautiful face writhing with pain.
[64840ms - 66420ms] I can hardly control myself.
[74970ms - 76890ms] That goddamn bitch!
[76890ms - 80600ms] I'll make you regret ever looking down on me like that!
[84480ms - 86440ms] You know what?
[87610ms - 90780ms] I bet she'll look just as beautiful as a corpse.
[91150ms - 94070ms] Her body will belong to her killer.
[94070ms - 97950ms] Yes, it will be all mine.
[98330ms - 102830ms] Every night I think the same thing and hate myself for it.
[103620ms - 107050ms] I'm really messed up in the head.
[112880ms - 116760ms] The classroom gets especially loud and unbearable during lunch.
[120020ms - 123310ms] But this place is much quieter.
[123770ms - 125940ms] It's the one place I feel at ease—
[125940ms - 126060ms] It's the one place I feel at ease—
[126060ms - 126190ms] It's the one place I feel at ease—
[145460ms - 146290ms] What?
[148880ms - 150670ms] What the heck?
[150670ms - 151800ms] What's she saying?!
[151800ms - 154010ms] Uhh...
[154590ms - 157800ms] Oh, yeah. Sure.
[159100ms - 160430ms] Thank goodness.
[160430ms - 161770ms] For what?
[162390ms - 164310ms] What the hell did she even say?
[164310ms - 167270ms] And what the heck is she even doing here in the first place?!
[167270ms - 171360ms] Wait, hang on now. Is this my chance to kill her?
[175320ms - 177820ms] No, now's not the time.
[178370ms - 180330ms] Let's just observe the situation.
[185330ms - 186250ms] What?
[186250ms - 188170ms] We just had lunch!
[188170ms - 190040ms] Isn't that a party-sized bag?!
[190340ms - 192210ms] Why's she smiling like that all alone?!
[192800ms - 194720ms] Wait, and what was with that rice ball?
[199680ms - 203140ms] Her humming's sounding more and more like a gorilla?!
[203770ms - 205020ms] What the hell?
[205020ms - 206770ms] What's with this girl?!
[208480ms - 210520ms] Chill out, man.
[210520ms - 213030ms] Just think about how you'll off her.
[221330ms - 223700ms] Is she working on the presentation we have for Social Studies?
[224250ms - 224910ms] All right!
[225960ms - 227330ms] She's not even gonna use a pencil first?!
[230540ms - 232920ms] See? You ran out of space.
[236630ms - 238510ms] Don't pretend like it's no big deal!
[240180ms - 242560ms] Huh? Where's my box cutter?
[244520ms - 246060ms] I've got mine!
[246730ms - 248560ms] But wait a minute...
[249230ms - 250770ms] Here, you can use mine.
[251730ms - 253770ms] Why were you carrying it around with you?
[254360ms - 255570ms] What a creep...
[257030ms - 260740ms] If she pulls that, then it'll be time for my big murder spectacular.
[270960ms - 273340ms] Y-You can use this if you want...
[276590ms - 278760ms] You just cut my workload in half!
[280720ms - 283140ms] Oh, that wasn't an intentional pun, okay?
[283140ms - 283760ms] Huh?
[283760ms - 285600ms] And, thanks!
[294190ms - 296110ms] At least she wasn't creeped out?
[296110ms - 297780ms] Wait, forget that...
[298110ms - 301780ms] Yamada is using my box cutter?!
[309410ms - 310210ms] My box cutter!
[314130ms - 316170ms] That's mine!
[316170ms - 318710ms] Yamada, where have you been?
[318710ms - 320970ms] I bet you were sneaking in snacks all alone.
[321470ms - 323010ms] No, I wasn't.
[326850ms - 327890ms] Here!
[329680ms - 331310ms] She's giving me her leftovers?
[331310ms - 332100ms] Oh...
[332560ms - 334060ms] I wasn't finished yet!
[349160ms - 351660ms] Hey! Don't make other people do your dirty work!
[351660ms - 353040ms] I wasn't!
[360380ms - 365090ms] J-Just when I was starting my murder countdown!
[370810ms - 372980ms] It's been a full day since then.
[372980ms - 376270ms] My box cutter is still in her pencil case.
[377820ms - 381240ms] My sharp tool is in her...
[382990ms - 385700ms] Right. Figures.
[387240ms - 388700ms] It's still warm!
[389580ms - 390620ms] Don't tell me...
[391000ms - 393080ms] Did she have it in her hand the whole way here?!
[393080ms - 395000ms] So she wouldn't forget?
[395000ms - 397920ms] Hey, did you watch last night?
[395670ms - 400130ms] No, maybe she's just trying not to give me any chance to finish her off.
[397920ms - 399380ms] I did. Did you, Yamada?
[399380ms - 400130ms] Nope.
[400130ms - 401460ms] You didn't?
[401460ms - 402510ms] Seriously?
[401460ms - 402510ms] Wait...
[402880ms - 405890ms] She knows which desk is mine, though?
[406680ms - 410810ms] Okay, today you'll be giving your group presentations.
[412600ms - 413560ms] Huh?
[414350ms - 416600ms] This isn't the poster I made yesterday.
[416600ms - 417900ms] Oh, that?
[418610ms - 422110ms] It was a total mess, so I redid the whole thing!
[422110ms - 425400ms] What?! You bitch! How could you?!
[425400ms - 428450ms] She worked so hard on that!
[425950ms - 427370ms] You did this one.
[427370ms - 429410ms] Didn't really have much time, see?
[429410ms - 430950ms] Girls disgust me!
[430950ms - 435580ms] They can't even hide how horrendously envious they get of anyone prettier than them!
[435580ms - 436580ms] I mean, look.
[436580ms - 441050ms] I could hardly believe you tried to use this chocolate smudge as part of the title.
[441050ms - 442800ms] That is pretty terrible, I guess.
[443050ms - 443800ms] See?
[444800ms - 447800ms] Chocolate? Seriously?
[447800ms - 451140ms] You're always so sloppy like that.
[448590ms - 451140ms] Doesn't really look like she cares, though?
[453390ms - 457060ms] We researched political party systems.
[457060ms - 459560ms] We looked up the US's two party system
[457560ms - 459560ms] This is so boring...
[459560ms - 461690ms] and the Japanese political system you all know...
[461690ms - 464900ms] Sh-She's got no life left in her!
[465150ms - 467200ms] It hurt her feelings after all!
[467200ms - 468910ms] So basically...
[468910ms - 472200ms] I think we should adopt the two party system, too!
[472200ms - 473540ms] Shut your face!
[474410ms - 478330ms] Our group researched the SDGs.
[478710ms - 482040ms] I wrote out our poster, so I'll let them handle the rest.
[478710ms - 483090ms] Are you all familiar with the SDGs?
[483090ms - 485970ms] SDG stands for Sustainable Development Goals,
[483500ms - 484670ms] Yamada?
[485970ms - 493010ms] and they got their start in 2000 at the United Nations as the MDGs,
[493010ms - 495680ms] Millennium Development Goals—
[495680ms - 498060ms] This dumb thing bothered her that much?!
[500520ms - 505150ms] Maybe in her eyes, it meant a whole lot more.
[505150ms - 507610ms] There are 169 different targets—
[508150ms - 509740ms] Huh? Is that a helicopter?
[509740ms - 510700ms] Think something happened?
[510700ms - 511820ms] Look at 'em all.
[511820ms - 513660ms] Think there was an accident?
[512620ms - 513660ms] Stop it!
[513660ms - 517040ms] Quit looking towards Yamada while she's crying, you ass-hats!
[517750ms - 519790ms] I need to distract them!
[521040ms - 523340ms] That concludes our presentation.
[528920ms - 531510ms] Wh-What the heck are you doing?!
[531510ms - 534810ms] W-We're finished, so who cares?
[537930ms - 539810ms] Go on, then.
[540230ms - 542440ms] I'm messed up in the head, anyway.
[542440ms - 544440ms] Now she can cry all she wants.
[544440ms - 546980ms] Isn't that a weird looking helicopter?
[546980ms - 548360ms] Think it's one of those osprey ones?
[548360ms - 549700ms] Like I know.
[551280ms - 553820ms] What the heck?!
[558700ms - 560790ms] Did you check out this month's volume of CiEL?
[560790ms - 561870ms] Not yet.
[561870ms - 564210ms] We definitely oughta switch places here, you giant!
[568590ms - 571010ms] You're so heavy!
[569800ms - 571010ms] Want an ass-kicking?!
[571340ms - 573510ms] Fine, then.
[573840ms - 575390ms] What is this, a moe anime?
[575390ms - 579390ms] They say girls who like that kinda close-contact got sex on the mind, right?
[579390ms - 582980ms] Imagine Kobayashi is her boyfriend for a sec.
[582980ms - 584100ms] Freakin' hot, right?
[584100ms - 586190ms] Quit being such a genius of a creep!
[587190ms - 590110ms] Wish a girl like Yamada and me could be FWBs.
[590110ms - 591900ms] I'm going to murder you, you pig!
[591900ms - 595120ms] I'm not really into girls that pretty.
[595120ms - 596160ms] This guy's into ugly girls?
[596160ms - 599370ms] Who's your type in this class, then?
[601710ms - 604420ms] S-Someone like Hara, maybe?
[606090ms - 607500ms] You're a real perv, dude.
[608210ms - 609590ms] Is your brain in your dick?
[609590ms - 610800ms] What the hell?
[615760ms - 617390ms] There she is again...
[618930ms - 620180ms] Hara!
[620810ms - 622390ms] Here for a book?
[622390ms - 624560ms] No, someone asked me to meet them here.
[624980ms - 626190ms] Want some?
[626190ms - 628980ms] No, I'm on a diet, so...
[631780ms - 632530ms] Me too...
[632530ms - 633650ms] Liar!
[635450ms - 640080ms] I eat what I want, when I want. That's my lifestyle!
[640080ms - 642750ms] Talk about saying something stupid like it's smart!
[642750ms - 647750ms] I did that too, but wound up like this.
[650050ms - 652210ms] Don't leave her hanging! Say something!
[654170ms - 655510ms] Kanzaki?
[655510ms - 658050ms] Oh, you're here already?
[658050ms - 660180ms] Yeah. So...
[661060ms - 662890ms] What did you want?
[664100ms - 665810ms] You're kidding me!
[665810ms - 667560ms] Is he about to ask her out?!
[668480ms - 670940ms] Well, you see...
[671730ms - 673070ms] Yeah?
[675990ms - 678570ms] Kinda strange seeing you two together, huh?
[678570ms - 680530ms] You're totally screwing this up, Yamada.
[680530ms - 684500ms] Oh, hey! They say fiber's good if you're on a diet.
[685160ms - 686170ms] Right...
[686170ms - 687710ms] You're on a diet?
[688710ms - 690290ms] I'm trying to lose weight.
[691340ms - 695220ms] I think girls are better with a little extra weight.
[695220ms - 698550ms] Guys have a totally different concept of "little" there, you know.
[698550ms - 699600ms] Right?
[699600ms - 701180ms] No, but...
[701180ms - 704350ms] I like 'em fat as they come.
[704350ms - 706440ms] 100 kilos or more, you know?
[706440ms - 710560ms] All squishy and layered.
[711320ms - 711940ms] Oh.
[711940ms - 712690ms] Cut it out!
[712690ms - 715400ms] Quit telling Yamada about your pervy fetish!
[718110ms - 720280ms] Pretty rude of you to only figure this out now!
[720280ms - 723080ms] But you know what you gotta do now, right?
[723080ms - 725410ms] Go on, then. Get outta there and leave them alone.
[727670ms - 728870ms] Is someone else in here?
[729960ms - 731380ms] M-Maybe it was a cat?
[731380ms - 734170ms] No one's gonna believe that!
[731380ms - 732880ms] A cat?
[739800ms - 742760ms] Is she trying to tell me to act like a cat?!
[747640ms - 750020ms] M-Meow.
[752900ms - 754190ms] I wish I was dead.
[755440ms - 757150ms] I'll go take a look.
[768040ms - 770540ms] A realistic meow isn't gonna cut it...
[770540ms - 772580ms] That's what they sound like when they fight.
[773290ms - 774420ms] Really?
[774420ms - 775210ms] Yeah.
[775210ms - 778590ms] That was a different cat, too. They might get into a fight.
[797900ms - 799190ms] You're into cats?
[799190ms - 800820ms] I have two of my own.
[800820ms - 802660ms] Wow, really?
[804450ms - 805370ms] Job's done.
[805370ms - 808200ms] Like you did a damn thing...
[809370ms - 810660ms] Glad that worked, huh?
[811370ms - 812330ms] Yeah...
[812670ms - 813630ms] See ya.
[819010ms - 822840ms] What am I doing helping her out?!
[826600ms - 828310ms] Yamada Anna...
[828310ms - 829890ms] What's that girl's deal?
[829890ms - 832190ms] Why are we always crossing paths?
[833520ms - 836230ms] She said she was in this month's volume, didn't she?
[843240ms - 845030ms] Definitely can't go in there dressed like this.
[845490ms - 847620ms] Thank you for shopping with us!
[853210ms - 855630ms] She said it was in CiEL, right?
[857170ms - 858550ms] This must be it.
[866550ms - 867930ms] Y-Yamada?!
[867930ms - 870470ms] No, it can't be...
[870470ms - 871930ms] Oh, good, they have it!
[872180ms - 874600ms] I've been hooked on this magazine, lately.
[874600ms - 876690ms] Yeah? What's in it?
[876690ms - 878230ms] Doesn't this look so pretty?
[878230ms - 879900ms] Oh yeah, for sure!
[879900ms - 881570ms] Yup, that's definitely her.
[881990ms - 884360ms] Is she seriously hoping to get noticed?
[891040ms - 892160ms] Don't make eye-contact!
[896790ms - 899290ms] Way to lose readers.
[904630ms - 909010ms] What? Cut that out! You're messing with the store now!
[911930ms - 915310ms] Quit standing ready to give out signatures! You're not even an author!
[923780ms - 925450ms] See? Right back where it should be.
[930830ms - 933500ms] She's got a pretty cringeworthy side to her too, huh?
[935750ms - 941630ms] F-Fine, guess I'll just have to buy it to make up for the girls she scared off.
[947340ms - 948590ms] Let's see, then...
[951390ms - 952970ms] It's an entirely different world.
[955520ms - 958520ms] Huh, I'm not seeing her in here...
[962570ms - 963610ms] There she is.
[973200ms - 977370ms] She looks like a completely different person.
[983500ms - 986130ms] Somehow I don't even give a damn anymore.
[986630ms - 989800ms] What was I even so worked up about, anyway?
[990800ms - 992180ms] I mean...
[992760ms - 997270ms] Me and Yamada have always been worlds apart.
[1000060ms - 1001730ms] What was I even thinking?
[1001730ms - 1004230ms] Everything suddenly seems so dumb and pointless.
[1008860ms - 1013030ms] Would be a waste not to use it at least once I guess, though.
[1022130ms - 1025130ms] Hardly got a wink of sleep last night.
[1025670ms - 1028670ms] Why the hell did I have to buy that crap?
[1036770ms - 1038390ms] Is that... her boyfriend?!
[1040190ms - 1042810ms] I mean, it figures.
[1042810ms - 1043810ms] Of course she has one.
[1043810ms - 1047730ms] Yup. That's just the way the world works.
[1049400ms - 1051740ms] Like I even care.
[1052780ms - 1055370ms] "LINE"? What's that?
[1056030ms - 1058040ms] C'mon, I know you use it.
[1058040ms - 1059450ms] Like this, see?
[1060000ms - 1061420ms] I'm Nanjo Haruya.
[1062500ms - 1063830ms] Is he trying to pick her up?
[1065210ms - 1066880ms] What about other social media?
[1066880ms - 1068460ms] "So shall me dee uh"?
[1068460ms - 1070970ms] You can't play that dumb.
[1071470ms - 1074340ms] How do you keep in touch with your friends, then?
[1076760ms - 1080730ms] We can read each others minds by tuning our brains to the same wavelength.
[1080730ms - 1083480ms] Oh, trying to weird him out, now?
[1081140ms - 1083480ms] The key is to tune your brain waves to the electromagnetic waves—
[1083940ms - 1086980ms] Can you read what's on my mind right now, then?
[1087320ms - 1088570ms] This guy's determined!
[1092200ms - 1093660ms] You want some ice cream!
[1093660ms - 1094740ms] More like you do!
[1094740ms - 1095990ms] Nope!
[1096660ms - 1100160ms] I was actually thinking how much cuter you look up close!
[1100160ms - 1104120ms] What a creep! She's not into you, dude.
[1104120ms - 1107000ms] You're pretty funny, you know that?
[1107340ms - 1109300ms] I am?! How so?!
[1110460ms - 1113430ms] That's what she was waiting for?
[1113430ms - 1115260ms] That whole, "I don't know what LINE is" bit.
[1115260ms - 1116890ms] Oh, that?
[1116890ms - 1120270ms] I've used that one so many times, I've got it down to a science!
[1121770ms - 1123940ms] I-I really don't know what it is, though!
[1125020ms - 1127770ms] You really are funny.
[1127770ms - 1129270ms] Aw, you're just saying that.
[1131650ms - 1134150ms] Quit looking like you enjoy it...
[1139240ms - 1139870ms] Hey.
[1142580ms - 1145210ms] Seriously though, give me your LINE.
[1145620ms - 1147460ms] No, I—
[1150800ms - 1152170ms] I'm not joking.
[1154170ms - 1154930ms] I—
[1161930ms - 1163060ms] Fine...
[1171270ms - 1173070ms] Not like it matters.
[1176410ms - 1177910ms] It doesn't matter, right?
[1183620ms - 1185500ms] It totally doesn't matter...
[1187710ms - 1191380ms] Am I really messed up in the head?
[1217240ms - 1219200ms] Yamada!
[1220780ms - 1222530ms] Chii, did you see that?
[1222530ms - 1225500ms] Ichikawa just sent his bike flying.
[1227750ms - 1229290ms] She saw that?
[1233460ms - 1234920ms] What did you do that for?
[1235420ms - 1237300ms] Uh, I just...
[1238590ms - 1239800ms] Well...
[1243810ms - 1246810ms] I hit the gas instead of the brakes.
[1263580ms - 1266370ms] You're pretty funny, Ichikawa.
