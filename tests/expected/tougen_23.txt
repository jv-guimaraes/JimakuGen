[8280ms - 10700ms] Lighting a beacon of hope at the journey's end
[10700ms - 14200ms] Walking on instinct, ignoring the noise
[14200ms - 17460ms] Searching for the real thing, though admittedly a little uncertain
[17460ms - 20120ms] I chase after your shadow
[20120ms - 23130ms] Win or lose, it was all-or-nothing
[23130ms - 24750ms] This game of moral justice, good and evil
[24750ms - 26510ms] Two sides of the same coin, entangled in rules
[26510ms - 27720ms] Flames wrapped in righteousness
[27720ms - 29840ms] "Only God knows our fate"
[29840ms - 31550ms] That's just a coward's way out
[31550ms - 33300ms] If you're going to bear a grudge, then be ready
[33300ms - 35260ms] If you've made up your mind, see it through
[35260ms - 36720ms] Yeah, shake it off, shake it off
[36720ms - 38390ms] Let all this absurdity shatter to pieces
[38390ms - 41270ms] Beyond the inner conflict, my thoughts are with you
[41270ms - 42100ms] As the days flow by
[42100ms - 44190ms] I hear the voices of my friends racing through my mind
[44190ms - 47150ms] In the sound of impermanence echoing all around
[48490ms - 51070ms] Living in chaos, mad and unrestrained
[51070ms - 54700ms] My heart's fate, drawn at random like an Amidakuji
[54700ms - 56950ms] In times of turmoil, whenever they come
[56950ms - 59460ms] Each wound I bear is proof of our bond
[59460ms - 61870ms] Wear them with pride
[63830ms - 66710ms] Oh oh oh ohh
[66800ms - 68710ms] Oh oh oh ohh
[69470ms - 72590ms] Oh oh oh ohh
[72680ms - 74140ms] Oh oh oh ohh
[74140ms - 75760ms] This is what a life worth loving looks like
[75760ms - 77180ms] Yeah, shake it off, shake it off
[77180ms - 78850ms] Let all this absurdity shatter to pieces
[78850ms - 81600ms] Beyond the inner conflict, my thoughts are with you
[81600ms - 82440ms] As the days flow by
[82440ms - 84690ms] I hear the voices of my friends racing through my mind
[84690ms - 87690ms] In the sound of impermanence echoing all around
[95150ms - 98160ms] That idiot. What's he thinking?
[98660ms - 101080ms] Conjuring multiple guns isn't easy.
[101580ms - 104200ms] It's like the "dominant hand rule."
[104750ms - 106540ms] Try writing with your nondominant hand.
[106540ms - 110790ms] It's never neat. Same principle.
[111710ms - 115210ms] It's only natural he can't get the hang of it right away.
[115460ms - 117840ms] For a weapon-materialization type like him,
[117840ms - 120470ms] he's gotta train with handling multiple real weapons first
[120470ms - 123810ms] before trying to control multiple blood weapons at once.
[124930ms - 130980ms] Even then, it takes insane mental strength, focus, and imagination.
[131480ms - 133820ms] Six guns at once, though?
[133820ms - 135230ms] Gives me chills.
[135650ms - 139990ms] Shiki Ichinose isn't the kind of guy who fights with his head.
[140990ms - 143910ms] You can multiply zero brains by anything.
[143910ms - 144990ms] It still comes out zero.
[145540ms - 149460ms] If he tries copying a genius, he's gonna die.
[158510ms - 161680ms] This is really bad.
[161680ms - 164220ms] I can't feel my right arm!
[165060ms - 167020ms] His regeneration can't keep up.
[167520ms - 169390ms] Maybe this is where he hits his limit.
[169730ms - 172100ms] I've gotta regroup.
[172100ms - 173650ms] How the hell do I—
[173650ms - 176280ms] No, I just need to move, anything!
[181070ms - 182240ms] I told you, didn't I?
[182740ms - 184530ms] You're weak.
[185330ms - 187370ms] This outcome was inevitable.
[189330ms - 190660ms] Farewell.
[191540ms - 195130ms] Your heartbeat's melody ends here.
[196670ms - 198130ms] Huh?
[198670ms - 200670ms] Am I dying?
[203930ms - 207640ms] Why the hell am I trying this hard?
[208220ms - 211560ms] Why am I even trying to pull out another gun?
[212140ms - 215020ms] I don't need to copy Mikado to fight.
[216150ms - 218650ms] I just have to do it my own way.
[220860ms - 222360ms] No, that's not it.
[222860ms - 224070ms] I know.
[224660ms - 228450ms] I... look up to Mikado.
[228950ms - 232160ms] I admire his strength.
[235960ms - 237210ms] Man...
[237710ms - 240380ms] I wish I could be like you, too.
[241510ms - 244840ms] If I were, things wouldn't have turned out this damn pathetic.
[246720ms - 250680ms] If I were stronger, I could stop more kids like Mei from ending up like that.
[251390ms - 253310ms] Even my dad...
[253730ms - 255730ms] he wouldn't have had to die.
[257310ms - 258940ms] Yeah.
[260570ms - 262190ms] Yeah, that's it!
[266950ms - 268700ms] I just wanna be stronger!
[269790ms - 271450ms] Like Mikado...
[274290ms - 275170ms] No.
[282800ms - 284180ms] Stronger than Mikado!
[284970ms - 285970ms] This is...
[287340ms - 290470ms] Stronger than Mikado!
[294020ms - 297480ms] Getting to meet someone like you, someone who made me feel this way,
[297480ms - 299980ms] seriously, I'm a happy guy!
[300230ms - 302320ms] So this is... Enki.
[303400ms - 304450ms] That guy...
[305280ms - 307700ms] he just materialized two guns.
[308530ms - 311990ms] Sure, the power of Enki is backing him up...
[312500ms - 315370ms] but once you get the hang of it, you've got it for good.
[315920ms - 318830ms] Let's see where this goes next.
[319920ms - 322630ms] When Mikado pointed his gun at me, I realized something.
[323130ms - 325590ms] His weapons were crafted down to the smallest detail.
[326220ms - 328890ms] To make something real, you've gotta picture it piece by piece,
[328890ms - 330510ms] as if you're building it from scratch.
[331060ms - 336100ms] Never thought all those times I took apart airsoft guns would pay off here.
[337020ms - 340150ms] But I'm still stuck at two guns, damn it.
[343190ms - 345400ms] Face to face, I can feel it on my skin.
[346150ms - 349030ms] An overwhelming pressure, like my blood's about to boil.
[349910ms - 352030ms] But so what?
[352540ms - 354620ms] That's no reason to run!
[367340ms - 369090ms] Block it like your life depends on it!
[369090ms - 370930ms] 'Cause you'll die if you don't!
[393990ms - 397370ms] It feels like I'm burning from both inside and out.
[398460ms - 400210ms] If I underestimate him,
[400460ms - 402210ms] I'll be turned to ash.
[402960ms - 405920ms] From here on out, I'm going all-in!
[406800ms - 409300ms] Sorry to keep you waiting.
[409300ms - 412220ms] I must have been so weak, it bored you, huh?
[412720ms - 414930ms] Now we can fight as equals.
[416270ms - 417350ms] Equals?
[418480ms - 419770ms] My friend...
[419770ms - 421350ms] don't you dare die on me!
[421650ms - 423400ms] Don't make me laugh!
[423400ms - 425610ms] You're out of your league!
[428110ms - 431110ms] In a gunfight, meeting head-on in a straight line isn't ideal...
[432030ms - 432870ms] so...
[439620ms - 442370ms] I'll attack from an angle you can't reach!
[444210ms - 447460ms] How? How are you up there?
[450260ms - 454470ms] He's melted the concrete with his heat and jammed his feet right into it.
[455510ms - 458270ms] Now I can pull that off, too!
[460390ms - 463020ms] The power's incredible, but...
[465270ms - 468400ms] ...your output's so huge, it makes your trajectory easy to read.
[468610ms - 469780ms] You're kidding me!
[470070ms - 472030ms] Which means it's easy to dodge!
[475780ms - 478660ms] He's right. There's got to be balance between strength and control.
[478660ms - 479620ms] Can I even do that?
[480330ms - 481870ms] Yeah, I can!
[482370ms - 485040ms] All I did was picture every detail,
[485040ms - 487290ms] and now all these images are flooding into my head!
[487550ms - 488750ms] I can do this.
[489510ms - 490420ms] I can do this!
[492130ms - 493220ms] I can do it!
[496300ms - 499010ms] Even holding back, that power's amazing.
[499010ms - 501680ms] And those flames, what a nuisance.
[501980ms - 503730ms] He's developing fast.
[504230ms - 508940ms] Thinkers pick things up quickly, but they take time to master them.
[509690ms - 513700ms] Meanwhile, instinctive types take longer to grasp the basics.
[513700ms - 515450ms] But once they do, they adapt fast,
[515450ms - 519450ms] especially when it's a friend who spurs it on.
[521250ms - 523580ms] Hell yeah! How's that?
[524370ms - 526290ms] Nothing to get cocky about.
[531880ms - 533420ms] An RPG?
[533420ms - 534720ms] Oh, crap!
[535970ms - 537970ms] This is seriously bad!
[544310ms - 545730ms] Close one.
[551530ms - 553150ms] A homing type?
[558160ms - 559580ms] No response.
[560700ms - 563120ms] He shouldn't be dead from a single hit.
[569340ms - 571090ms] Did he aim short on purpose?
[579220ms - 581100ms] Shit! I'm fallin'!
[584850ms - 586020ms] Damn it!
[586890ms - 588480ms] Let go of that!
[621010ms - 624600ms] Weirdly enough, this fight ain't half bad, huh?
[624600ms - 626890ms] Feels like I've still got more left to give.
[627390ms - 630400ms] Laughing in the middle of a fight.
[630400ms - 632230ms] You're insane.
[632230ms - 633900ms] What are you talking about?
[634900ms - 637700ms] Mikado Momodera had always been cool and detached.
[638280ms - 641280ms] His strength had never once made him burn with passion.
[642280ms - 646660ms] And then, one day, Shiki Ichinose appeared before him.
[647160ms - 652540ms] Without a doubt, this man would set Mikado's heart ablaze.
[655050ms - 657720ms] You're smilin', too, aren't you?
[688540ms - 689870ms] Hey, Mikado.
[700130ms - 704510ms] When I'm with you, I feel like I can keep growin' stronger.
[705760ms - 710680ms] I wanna be that kind of person for you, too.
[714270ms - 715440ms] Uh-oh.
[727120ms - 728410ms] He's going berserk?
[732080ms - 733370ms] So heavy...
[744800ms - 747390ms] He's on a whole different level from before.
[773460ms - 775540ms] There's no opening to counter.
[776130ms - 778960ms] It's unlike any other Oni's rampage.
[778960ms - 780590ms] Pure, mindless slaughter.
[781630ms - 783170ms] This is an Oni?
[784720ms - 787340ms] No. This is a demon!
[797900ms - 800770ms] Looks like the Kishin power went over capacity.
[817670ms - 820920ms] Even with my full defense, this much damage...
[833220ms - 834680ms] Is this as far as I go?
[848660ms - 850490ms] Mikado...
[851780ms - 855750ms] kill... me.
[856750ms - 862710ms] Or else... I'll... kill... you.
[863590ms - 866760ms] Kill me...
[867260ms - 871470ms] before I... lose it... completely.
[872180ms - 875720ms] Please... hurry.
[876640ms - 878390ms] He's still conscious?
[880560ms - 883980ms] I don't wanna...
[883980ms - 887490ms] kill my friend.
[892030ms - 895240ms] Kill... me!
[901630ms - 903750ms] Hey, dumbass Momo, listen up.
[903750ms - 905800ms] I'll draw Ichinose away.
[905800ms - 909010ms] In the meantime, haul your wrecked body up and finish this.
[909260ms - 912680ms] The worst-case scenario is he goes down into the city.
[912680ms - 915140ms] Civilians will die.
[915390ms - 918850ms] I don't care what you think. Get up and blast him.
[918850ms - 920230ms] Shoot like you mean to kill him.
[920640ms - 922150ms] Otherwise you won't stop him.
[922650ms - 927440ms] But if you really do kill Ichinose, I'll kill you.
[928610ms - 930570ms] You're contradicting yourself.
[930570ms - 934280ms] But you're right. We can't involve civilians.
[934280ms - 936200ms] In this condition, I need to prep.
[936200ms - 937370ms] Give me five minutes.
[937660ms - 940620ms] Get ready quick. We don't have time to waste.
[941420ms - 943380ms] You don't need to tell me.
[943380ms - 945750ms] But I can't promise you won't catch flak, too.
[946000ms - 948380ms] Cocky for someone who's got one foot in the grave.
[949420ms - 954300ms] Well, then, let's see how far a so-called noncombatant can go.
[954300ms - 955800ms] This is gonna sting.
[958890ms - 960730ms] Bring it on, brat!
[961560ms - 964730ms] Can you see me with those peepers?
[986380ms - 989170ms] Damn. Can't even get close.
[989670ms - 992220ms] Guess I'll focus on keeping his attention.
[993260ms - 994470ms] Still, though...
[994720ms - 996300ms] it's cruel.
[996300ms - 999180ms] To still be conscious while in a berserk state.
[1000270ms - 1005100ms] Run... away.
[1013490ms - 1018990ms] I really... will... kill you.
[1019790ms - 1024960ms] It'd probably be easier if you'd just give in to the rage and black out.
[1026500ms - 1028170ms] But that willpower of yours,
[1028170ms - 1030130ms] that stubborn fight against losing yourself...
[1030130ms - 1032260ms] Run... away.
[1032630ms - 1035340ms] ...I won't let it be in vain, jackass.
[1037640ms - 1042020ms] I've never heard of an Oni in berserk mode still being conscious!
[1043390ms - 1044770ms] He's crying.
[1045020ms - 1047650ms] Berserk Oni are supposed to be mindless weapons.
[1048150ms - 1051610ms] Killing them is the right thing to do, or so I thought.
[1053650ms - 1055820ms] Then why is he crying?
[1056860ms - 1060700ms] Doesn't that mean he still has awareness? Feelings?
[1061910ms - 1064540ms] Could it be all the Oni I've killed before...
[1065160ms - 1067580ms] were crying, too?
[1069170ms - 1071500ms] Then how much pain must that be...
[1072000ms - 1073710ms] wanting not to hurt anyone,
[1073710ms - 1076220ms] yet ending up hurting everyone around you?
[1077550ms - 1079850ms] Even through that pain...
[1080640ms - 1082390ms] you still worried about me.
[1083390ms - 1085230ms] Even as you cried...
[1086730ms - 1091480ms] You've always been so honest and so kind.
[1094440ms - 1096990ms] I don't wanna...
[1096990ms - 1100200ms] kill my friend.
[1101450ms - 1103450ms] Even after losing himself...
[1104450ms - 1105910ms] he still called me his friend.
[1108000ms - 1109790ms] I'm such a fool!
[1115840ms - 1116800ms] It must hurt.
[1117300ms - 1118510ms] It must be unbearable.
[1119010ms - 1119840ms] Ichinose...
[1120260ms - 1122430ms] No, Shiki!
[1122930ms - 1127390ms] I'll end your suffering with my own hands.
[1130480ms - 1132190ms] Unreal.
[1132190ms - 1135440ms] Even when I disappear from sight, he tracks me with his other senses.
[1138200ms - 1139110ms] Shit!
[1143280ms - 1144450ms] You've gotta be kidding me.
[1151500ms - 1152630ms] Damn it.
[1153090ms - 1155300ms] Of all things, my leg.
[1155800ms - 1157260ms] What a pain in the ass.
[1157630ms - 1160510ms] If he takes him out, he'll come for me next.
[1161010ms - 1163640ms] What do I do? I'm still not ready.
[1164890ms - 1167890ms] The more I think about it, the more hopeless it feels.
[1169440ms - 1172900ms] This is why I hate babysitting kids.
[1173190ms - 1175360ms] Run.
[1175900ms - 1177900ms] I'm a disgrace.
[1178440ms - 1179650ms] Ichinose...
[1181280ms - 1183910ms] don't feel guilty about my death.
[1204890ms - 1207180ms] What's with that peaceful look?
[1208390ms - 1211020ms] You planning to retire to the afterlife already?
[1211890ms - 1213440ms] Sorry I'm late.
[1213690ms - 1216400ms] Your dramatic entrance pisses me off.
[1217270ms - 1219400ms] No need for a status report.
[1223360ms - 1225240ms] I've got a pretty good idea what's going on.
[1230700ms - 1233920ms] So when are you planning to fire that thing?
[1234880ms - 1237590ms] Showing up out of nowhere and acting all high and mighty, huh?
[1240840ms - 1242470ms] I'm ready.
[1247810ms - 1248640ms] Fire...
[1249600ms - 1250850ms] I have to fire.
[1251600ms - 1256310ms] There's no way to save him except death to free him from his pain.
[1257730ms - 1259940ms] At least let it be by my hand!
[1261240ms - 1262360ms] Mi...
[1263530ms - 1266120ms] Mikado...
[1269990ms - 1274120ms] Feeling this way makes me a failure as a Momotaro.
[1275540ms - 1276750ms] But I don't care anymore.
[1277250ms - 1279500ms] Momotaro, Oni, none of that matters!
[1280800ms - 1284970ms] This is the will of me, Mikado Momodera, as a person!
[1286760ms - 1287720ms] Please.
