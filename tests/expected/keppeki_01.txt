[5910ms - 9480ms] We're deep into added time at the end of the second half, and the score remains 1-1.
[13190ms - 18490ms] This will probably be the last action of the game for Japan's Under-16s.
[40530ms - 42730ms] Goal!
[54830ms - 58300ms] You know, I don't mind you celebrating...
[57070ms - 59420ms] Aoyama!
[60330ms - 63190ms] ...but can you please not hug me and stuff?
[65410ms - 66570ms] You'll get me dirty.
[71500ms - 73860ms] Aoyama-kun sure is a clean freak.
[176760ms - 179030ms] Aoyama-kyun...
[177110ms - 179030ms] So cool!
[179030ms - 180360ms] It's so clean!
[179510ms - 181530ms] I wish he'd wipe it every day!
[190090ms - 191130ms] Aoyama-kun!
[191130ms - 193250ms] Wow, it's so sparkly!
[193930ms - 195990ms] You're amazing, Aoyama!
[196650ms - 198060ms] Aoyama-kun!
[198810ms - 200530ms] I get it, Aoyama.
[200530ms - 203260ms] Even as you clean, you feel like the dirt keeps coming back,
[203260ms - 207260ms] leaving you in an endless loop where you just keep cleaning forever.
[207260ms - 210440ms] A-o-ya-ma!
[212260ms - 214150ms] Practice has already started.
[215390ms - 216600ms] Zaizen-san...
[219220ms - 220840ms] You're already worn out!
[220840ms - 222820ms] Do you have enough in the tank for practice?!
[227670ms - 229030ms] I want to hear you guys!
[229030ms - 229910ms] Yes, sir!
[229910ms - 232270ms] Aoyama-kun!
[236450ms - 238170ms] What kind of soap are you using?
[246300ms - 249530ms] Aoyama-kun, that's some impressive lathering!
[249530ms - 250470ms] Far post!
[251010ms - 252600ms] Keep your eyes on your man!
[254060ms - 254900ms] Here it comes!
[254900ms - 257860ms] Aoyama-kun!
[258280ms - 259640ms] His hands are so clean.
[259640ms - 261320ms] Look at his fingertips!
[261320ms - 263320ms] Damn you...
[264390ms - 266740ms] How long are you going to keep that up?
[266740ms - 268530ms] I'll kill you!
[275580ms - 278040ms] That's enough.
[282860ms - 283920ms] Coach Miwa.
[284360ms - 288530ms] Kaocchi, Aoyama's an extreme germaphobe.
[289690ms - 292890ms] Could you please stop calling me that?
[292890ms - 293850ms] Ah, it's all good.
[293850ms - 296820ms] Just keep an eye out for him, as his senior.
[296820ms - 299820ms] After all, you'll be linking up because of the positions you play.
[301420ms - 302360ms] "Linking up..."
[306660ms - 307450ms] Pass!
[309700ms - 310700ms] Header!
[311870ms - 312790ms] Eek!
[314180ms - 316600ms] I don't see it working in the slightest,
[317180ms - 320540ms] but with him on the team, winning the district prelims isn't a pipe dream.
[322270ms - 324010ms] Hey, Aoyama!
[324920ms - 326760ms] Make sure you stay hydrated.
[328850ms - 329890ms] No.
[331340ms - 332920ms] Drink it!
[332920ms - 334350ms] I'd rather die.
[334810ms - 335510ms] What?
[336360ms - 338690ms] I told you. He's a germaphobe.
[342250ms - 345740ms] He won't use something if someone else has touched or drank from it.
[347570ms - 349490ms] Does he really have to wash it?
[351290ms - 353160ms] Here it comes!
[354380ms - 355870ms] Just you watch, Aoyama...
[357100ms - 358700ms] It's a cross!
[360770ms - 362300ms] I have the height advantage.
[362800ms - 366290ms] I'll jump higher than you and score!
[368260ms - 369760ms] Why isn't he jumping?
[372580ms - 373780ms] Gotcha!
[376140ms - 379220ms] Just leave the muscleheads to us.
[379220ms - 380290ms] We got this.
[380810ms - 383320ms] That was a blatant foul!
[383650ms - 385250ms] Is it a throw-in?
[385250ms - 387190ms] I'll take it!
[387190ms - 387740ms] Thank you.
[388290ms - 390310ms] What is this?
[391010ms - 392460ms] Don't get so worked up.
[392460ms - 394330ms] That guy's kinda fun.
[394330ms - 397060ms] Exactly. The real winners are the ones who have the most fun.
[397060ms - 398660ms] Keep it fun!
[401380ms - 403290ms] Aoyama-kun!
[402760ms - 403940ms] Here it comes!
[414780ms - 418130ms] If you think you can get away with everything just because you're good,
[418130ms - 420390ms] you're in for a rude awakening, you idiot!
[420390ms - 423310ms] And you guys! Quit coddling him!
[423670ms - 424820ms] You know what I mean!
[424820ms - 430110ms] Dude, don't you realize you're far more coddled than he is?
[433260ms - 436060ms] I mean, just look at those brand spanking new cleats.
[436060ms - 438500ms] He's right! Coddle City!
[438910ms - 441610ms] I got these from my daddy— I mean, my old man!
[441610ms - 444970ms] Oldest son of a business mogul? What is your life, a TV show?!
[444970ms - 446610ms] Get outta here, Richie Rich!
[447770ms - 450580ms] And what is with that old butler ferrying you to and from school?!
[450580ms - 451890ms] Yeah! Right on!
[451890ms - 454860ms] Try experiencing the crush of a morning rush hour train for once!
[454860ms - 456340ms] Amen!
[456340ms - 460770ms] Seriously? I'm the more coddled one here?
[461340ms - 462190ms] No!
[463140ms - 466440ms] Being spoiled rotten has nothing to do with this...
[466440ms - 470190ms] ...and you have even less to do with this, baseball team!
[470940ms - 472360ms] Hey, Aoyama!
[473750ms - 476260ms] You're gonna start taking soccer seriously!
[476260ms - 479170ms] I told you all to get along!
[479670ms - 480650ms] There it is!
[480650ms - 482080ms] Miwa-chan's "ippon seoi nage" throw!
[482080ms - 484170ms] That's a third dan judo master for you!
[487070ms - 488540ms] Another clean throw.
[488540ms - 494180ms] Why is a judo aficionado even coaching the soccer team?
[501020ms - 502520ms] He jumps out of the way of passes,
[503020ms - 504480ms] he won't head the ball,
[504900ms - 507670ms] and any kind of contact play is out.
[507670ms - 509820ms] I don't care how talented he is.
[509820ms - 512900ms] I will never accept someone like him!
[523620ms - 524790ms] Hey, what are you doing?
[524790ms - 527640ms] U-Um, I...
[531050ms - 532710ms] What was that all about?
[533140ms - 534060ms] Kaocchi.
[536350ms - 537640ms] Coach?
[538220ms - 541100ms] I really would like you to stop calling me that.
[543420ms - 544940ms] What's up?
[544940ms - 547610ms] I'll take care of locking up the clubhouse.
[547610ms - 551230ms] It's not that. It's about Aoyama being a clean freak.
[552940ms - 555110ms] I don't care if he's a clean freak or whatever.
[555110ms - 558790ms] He's either not serious about soccer, or he just doesn't care.
[558790ms - 559810ms] You think so?
[559810ms - 561050ms] It's obvious!
[561660ms - 563500ms] He'll use wanting to stay clean as an excuse
[563500ms - 566230ms] to just look on when the game's hanging in the balance.
[567490ms - 570440ms] He won't even touch the ball without rubber gloves.
[570440ms - 571510ms] You're right about that.
[578860ms - 586490ms] After every session, Aoyama cleans the balls like that without fail.
[588420ms - 591200ms] Well, sure he does. He is a clean freak, after all.
[591200ms - 593360ms] But why does he put on that ridiculous outfit to do it?
[593910ms - 597310ms] He has to, or else he can't clean the balls.
[597310ms - 598820ms] It's a tremendous handicap.
[599910ms - 602870ms] He can't do what everybody is able to do naturally.
[603750ms - 605950ms] You sweat and get dirty.
[605950ms - 609860ms] Once the game starts, you can't avoid contact with others.
[610380ms - 612250ms] It must be rough for a germaphobe.
[613570ms - 617490ms] In spite of all that, he engages in soccer activities every day.
[618670ms - 623180ms] Polishing the balls is probably like a ritual to him.
[623630ms - 626140ms] It's like a "thank you" to the balls.
[627810ms - 630500ms] Aoyama is a true soccer nerd.
[631100ms - 634000ms] Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun
[634000ms - 636990ms] Hot-Blooded Scion! Zaizen Kaoru
[640040ms - 643370ms] So this is Fujimi High School, where I'll find Aoyama.
[643880ms - 645300ms] I don't believe this.
[645300ms - 647440ms] Oh, well. It won't matter once I win.
[648540ms - 651490ms] From tomorrow, you'll be part of our team!
[652950ms - 655640ms] That's the famous Oshigami-Minami High.
[656460ms - 660840ms] That's Takechi, the guy who was picked along with Aoyama for Japan's Under-16s.
[660840ms - 662820ms] He's Tokyo's number one forward.
[664900ms - 666550ms] Thank you.
[666550ms - 667580ms] Thank you.
[668270ms - 671140ms] I heard they'd only send the reserves...
[671970ms - 673230ms] He's coming this way.
[673800ms - 675110ms] Fine by me.
[675110ms - 676650ms] I'll go introduce myself.
[676650ms - 678690ms] Hey! Don't cause any trouble!
[680340ms - 680850ms] Hey.
[680850ms - 682610ms] It's been a while, Aoyama!
[683990ms - 685080ms] Takechi-san?
[686290ms - 689180ms] That over-waxed little gel-head!
[694950ms - 697050ms] He's actually gelled it really well.
[697790ms - 700510ms] Aoyama, why did you reject our invitation?
[701340ms - 705470ms] This school crashes out in the district preliminaries every year.
[706070ms - 708390ms] You've been given a gift.
[709150ms - 712080ms] So where's the sense in letting it go to waste here?
[712080ms - 713850ms] Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!
[714600ms - 719880ms] I bet you guys can't comprehend the artistry or true value of Aoyama's game!
[721060ms - 726410ms] I can't allow Aoyama to keep playing on this team of scrubs.
[727830ms - 730160ms] Just who the hell do you think you are?!
[731670ms - 733390ms] Don't touch me.
[733390ms - 734380ms] Takechi-san.
[736270ms - 741580ms] I came to this school because it has something unique about it.
[745210ms - 746210ms] Aoyama...
[750740ms - 751810ms] Goal!
[751810ms - 754300ms] Oshigami-Minami takes the lead!
[757100ms - 758190ms] Dammit...
[758610ms - 761480ms] What could this team possibly have that brought you here?
[764580ms - 767070ms] Will you show me in this match?
[767720ms - 772010ms] Takechi-san, why are you showing off your abs?
[772010ms - 774260ms] It's gross. Could you please stop?
[774820ms - 781300ms] You need a fit, muscular body to get you through the rigors of this game!
[781720ms - 785260ms] You want to have a body like mine too, right?
[806110ms - 808190ms] Aoyama's on the attack!
[808190ms - 808910ms] Close him down!
[809300ms - 810710ms] R-Right!
[810710ms - 811870ms] This is bad!
[814580ms - 816580ms] I don't care if you foul him!
[816580ms - 818290ms] Just stop him in his tracks!
[824590ms - 826070ms] It's no use. We can't stop him.
[826690ms - 827720ms] I'll just have to...
[829690ms - 830520ms] Huh?
[831640ms - 833670ms] Keeper!
[842820ms - 843790ms] He's not shooting?
[844300ms - 845940ms] You think you can mess around?
[845940ms - 848660ms] I'll grab it before you get past me!
[855910ms - 856750ms] What?
[863630ms - 865080ms] Goal!
[865080ms - 867480ms] Aoyama-kun!
[867480ms - 870390ms] Damn. He made that goal all by himself.
[870870ms - 872150ms] Exquisite.
[873780ms - 875960ms] He didn't let anyone lay a finger on him,
[875960ms - 878550ms] and then he finished it off with a rabona nutmeg!
[878550ms - 879810ms] That's so like him.
[879810ms - 883800ms] In order to stay out of touching distance from other players,
[883800ms - 886200ms] Aoyama's movements are frighteningly precise,
[886200ms - 888240ms] and that's consistently true, from start to finish.
[888740ms - 891200ms] If defenders come near him, he dribbles right through them.
[891200ms - 894660ms] Or he hits a telling one-touch pass.
[894660ms - 898250ms] Fearing this, the defenders can't mark him too tightly.
[899740ms - 901700ms] However, if they give him space,
[902660ms - 904170ms] he has an unrivaled precision shot.
[907220ms - 909900ms] This is the playing style Aoyama arrived at...
[909900ms - 912050ms] after considering all of the things he cannot do.
[912050ms - 916040ms] The germaphobe's absolute domain.
[917310ms - 918920ms] We took the lead!
[918920ms - 921520ms] We're a goal up on the illustrious Oshigami-Minami.
[921520ms - 925480ms] Yes, Aoyama! That's goal number two!
[925910ms - 928950ms] I don't want to admit it, but he has real skill.
[930340ms - 931950ms] H-He didn't move?
[934770ms - 938330ms] He's really consistent about not doing anything that'll get him dirty.
[938330ms - 940750ms] Fujimi
[938330ms - 940750ms] 1st 2nd Total
[938330ms - 940750ms] Oshigami- Minami
[943960ms - 948680ms] Takechi-san's on edge because we ended the first half 2-1 behind.
[949540ms - 950400ms] Tachibana!
[950400ms - 951170ms] Yes!
[952260ms - 955720ms] Did you see Aoyama's almost illegally beautiful plays?
[956470ms - 959170ms] He is a veritable treasure of Japan's soccer world.
[959170ms - 962190ms] Takechi-san, he's still our opponent.
[962190ms - 963650ms] I know.
[964000ms - 967070ms] We won't let him have his way in the second half!
[967820ms - 969780ms] The second half is beginning!
[976130ms - 978200ms] Four defenders marking Aoyama?!
[979500ms - 982230ms] Dammit. There's no way to pass to Aoyama!
[982230ms - 983160ms] Captain!
[983700ms - 984620ms] All right, Tada!
[988170ms - 989740ms] Laughable.
[989740ms - 992020ms] As long as Aoyama doesn't get the ball,
[992020ms - 995050ms] Fujimi High has even less bite than a toothless tiger.
[995580ms - 997010ms] You wish!
[997010ms - 999860ms] Putting four men on Aoyama gives the rest of us a lot more space!
[999860ms - 1001330ms] We'll attack without him!
[1001330ms - 1002150ms] There!
[1002850ms - 1004270ms] Watch this!
[1006300ms - 1009230ms] Wow, this guy can't use his feet at all.
[1009610ms - 1012470ms] Ugly. That was too ugly for words.
[1012890ms - 1015580ms] I understand what you're trying to do,
[1015580ms - 1018060ms] but you know you're not great with the ball at your feet.
[1018060ms - 1019200ms] Dammit!
[1027620ms - 1028960ms] This is bad.
[1028960ms - 1034380ms] Fujimi
[1028960ms - 1034380ms] 1st 2nd Total
[1028960ms - 1034380ms] Oshigami- Minami
[1029480ms - 1034380ms] Just by shutting down Aoyama, the difference is stark.
[1036300ms - 1038500ms] You get it now, don't you?
[1039530ms - 1043640ms] This isn't where you're supposed to be, Aoyama.
[1044090ms - 1046540ms] It's not too late. Join us.
[1047740ms - 1049980ms] Kaocchi! Come here!
[1051430ms - 1053080ms] Ten minutes left.
[1053080ms - 1055620ms] But isn't there something wrong with Aoyama's movements?
[1055620ms - 1057890ms] Normally, it doesn't matter how many people there are on him.
[1058410ms - 1059410ms] You're right.
[1060370ms - 1063750ms] It's possible he's injured.
[1063750ms - 1065250ms] Hey, Aoyama!
[1066980ms - 1069750ms] Are you hurt or something?
[1070390ms - 1071450ms] No.
[1072280ms - 1073560ms] What gives, then?
[1073560ms - 1074250ms] Huh?
[1075110ms - 1076780ms] Son of a... Look at your feet!
[1078630ms - 1081540ms] Don't tell me you're just avoiding getting dirty!
[1084630ms - 1085890ms] Stop screwing around!
[1085890ms - 1088440ms] If you don't want to play, get off the field!
[1093090ms - 1098430ms] I came to this school because it has something unique about it.
[1099630ms - 1103120ms] Why? Why did you come here?!
[1103120ms - 1107730ms] In the first half, I actually thought you might be serious about soccer.
[1108290ms - 1110750ms] But now, you're just...
[1114290ms - 1115670ms] You disappoint me.
[1115670ms - 1117590ms] Last five minutes!
[1118350ms - 1119340ms] I got this!
[1122310ms - 1123930ms] Oh crap!
[1125870ms - 1128770ms] Losers, all of you! This is...
[1129730ms - 1131400ms] ...the end!
[1138860ms - 1140910ms] He blocked it with his face?!
[1141530ms - 1142950ms] Counterattack!
[1146130ms - 1147540ms] I...
[1147910ms - 1150970ms] I don't have the skill or talent Aoyama has.
[1152020ms - 1153090ms] But you know what?
[1154460ms - 1157420ms] It doesn't matter if the opponent's a famous school or not...
[1158040ms - 1159880ms] I want to win!
[1160660ms - 1161380ms] Zaizen!
[1162420ms - 1166680ms] I'm giving soccer everything I've got here!
[1176500ms - 1178230ms] Damn you!
[1206300ms - 1208220ms] Goal!
[1214060ms - 1217380ms] I thought you didn't want to get dirty.
[1218090ms - 1220990ms] If it's just the last five minutes, I can handle it.
[1221650ms - 1224910ms] I really hate losing.
[1225660ms - 1226820ms] This guy...
[1228740ms - 1231660ms] Aoyama's a clean freak who has a rod up his ass,
[1231660ms - 1234510ms] so to be honest, I don't like this first-year.
[1237420ms - 1239380ms] 1st
[1237420ms - 1239380ms] 2nd
[1237420ms - 1239380ms] Total
[1237770ms - 1239380ms] But you know what?
[1239380ms - 1241340ms] Yippee!
[1243300ms - 1246660ms] When it comes to the desire to win, he's just like us.
[1247730ms - 1251720ms] That makes him a reliable teammate!
[1255140ms - 1257150ms] Aoyama, you bastard!
[1258930ms - 1261570ms] Nice header, Zaizen-san.
[1268340ms - 1269720ms] You can have this.
[1269720ms - 1272450ms] You're more worthy of the number 10.
[1273420ms - 1274910ms] Zaizen-san...
[1275430ms - 1277320ms] I... don't want it.
[1277880ms - 1279270ms] Put it on!
[1279270ms - 1280910ms] I'd rather die.
[1280910ms - 1283420ms] Is my shirt that dirty?!
[1281590ms - 1283960ms] Aoyama-kun!
[1285930ms - 1287010ms] I won't stand for this!
[1287750ms - 1291720ms] We were supposed to show our superiority and talk Aoyama into joining us.
[1291720ms - 1294640ms] But instead, we lost! Unthinkable!
[1295570ms - 1297980ms] Perhaps I should transfer to Fujimi High.
[1297980ms - 1299020ms] What?
[1299020ms - 1301900ms] But I wonder what Aoyama was talking about.
[1302250ms - 1305820ms] What is so unique about Fujimi High?
[1309700ms - 1311580ms] I'm glad I came here.
[1314010ms - 1316460ms] Every toilet needs this feature.
[1410730ms - 1412040ms] I've decided.
[1412540ms - 1415570ms] I'm going to support Aoyama-kun in my own way.
