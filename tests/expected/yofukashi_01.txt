[175320ms - 177080ms] This is so nice.
[178030ms - 181410ms] For the first time ever, I ventured out at night without telling anyone.
[184710ms - 186420ms] It's kinda freeing.
[189500ms - 191630ms] This is where I belong.
[191630ms - 192800ms] I wish!
[198470ms - 204020ms] After all, I'm supposed to go to school and sleep at night.
[208150ms - 210690ms] I haven't done this in forever! It's so much fun!
[219530ms - 222830ms] My sleeping problem started recently.
[226750ms - 230710ms] I'm Yamori Kou, age 14, in my second year of junior high.
[231630ms - 233720ms] I was getting by just fine.
[234420ms - 235470ms] I think.
[240310ms - 241100ms] Sorry.
[242390ms - 245440ms] I'm just not into dating and all that stuff.
[253150ms - 254990ms] It's not that I wasn't happy.
[254990ms - 256450ms] But what could I do?
[257070ms - 260830ms] I really don't get the whole thing about truly liking or hating somebody.
[262580ms - 264950ms] Yamori, why'd you reject her?
[265200ms - 266910ms] She was crying, you know.
[268080ms - 268920ms] Sorry.
[269830ms - 271420ms] That's your response?
[271420ms - 272550ms] You suck.
[274960ms - 277840ms] Suddenly, I just got sick of it all.
[283640ms - 285430ms] Ow...
[286390ms - 289020ms] I was really flying there.
[291020ms - 293820ms] The most pressing issue is that I can't sleep.
[294780ms - 300240ms] Advice I found online said I should talk to family or someone I can trust.
[300620ms - 303200ms] Someone I can trust, huh?
[303200ms - 306290ms] If I had someone like that, I wouldn't be in this mess!
[308460ms - 309670ms] C-Crap!
[309670ms - 311210ms] Did they find out?
[311210ms - 313000ms] That I'm out on my own?
[316760ms - 318670ms] Yeah, of course they didn't.
[319090ms - 320390ms] Not my parents.
[329190ms - 331020ms] So much stuff about booze!
[331020ms - 332650ms] You sure are enjoying yourselves!
[333730ms - 336780ms] But I've never even tried drinking...
[340280ms - 344200ms] I never knew vending machines were this bright at night.
[363180ms - 365140ms] Oh, you're buying booze.
[366600ms - 368220ms] Nice.
[373100ms - 374560ms] Hold on.
[374560ms - 376360ms] How old are you?
[376360ms - 379490ms] No way are you old enough to drink.
[379490ms - 382410ms] Oh crap. Who's this?
[382410ms - 383870ms] But more importantly, I gotta...
[384910ms - 386580ms] No, uh, someone asked me to—
[386580ms - 388580ms] I mean, um, I made a mistake!
[388580ms - 389830ms] Just an honest mistake!
[389830ms - 391250ms] Well, gotta go!
[392500ms - 394460ms] You think that's gonna fool me, delinquent?
[394460ms - 396670ms] I-It's not what you think, really.
[396670ms - 399090ms] I don't usually do this kind of thing.
[399090ms - 400970ms] Chill.
[400970ms - 405800ms] I'm not gonna rat you out to the cops.
[405800ms - 406390ms] Huh?
[411600ms - 413600ms] You can't sleep,
[413980ms - 415060ms] can you, boy?
[419230ms - 421650ms] Let me help you.
[423110ms - 426660ms] Why do you think people stay up at night?
[426660ms - 430450ms] Because there's a show they want to watch or something they want to do?
[430450ms - 432620ms] Or they're anxious about tomorrow?
[433500ms - 435370ms] What's with this woman?
[436040ms - 437340ms] A woman...
[437340ms - 438540ms] A woman, right.
[439710ms - 442010ms] What does she mean by "help"?
[442920ms - 447390ms] It all boils down to one reason.
[447850ms - 450930ms] They aren't satisfied with how they spent the day.
[450930ms - 452230ms] Take a look.
[452560ms - 455060ms] See how satisfied they look!
[455060ms - 457900ms] Fast asleep without a care in the world!
[458770ms - 460530ms] Aren't they just totally wasted?
[460530ms - 461650ms] Hey, old man!
[461650ms - 463030ms] Huh?
[463490ms - 464860ms] Didja drink plenty?
[464860ms - 468320ms] Yeah, plenty!
[468320ms - 469370ms] Plen'y.
[469370ms - 470240ms] Plenny...
[470790ms - 471700ms] Yeah!
[472330ms - 473910ms] Yeah! Yeah!
[476250ms - 477750ms] 'Kay, later then!
[477750ms - 479840ms] Make sure you get home and sleep.
[479840ms - 481000ms] Okay!
[482380ms - 483840ms] H-Hey!
[484670ms - 486550ms] Did you know those people?
[486550ms - 488510ms] Nope, not at all.
[488510ms - 490010ms] Really?!
[490010ms - 491970ms] You're that casual with strangers?
[491970ms - 493600ms] What are you talking about?
[494930ms - 496850ms] This is the nighttime, y'know.
[496850ms - 498600ms] It's time to be free.
[498600ms - 502780ms] You'll never be satisfied if you don't let loose,
[503480ms - 504490ms] boy.
[508700ms - 511240ms] H-Hey! Heading home already?
[511700ms - 514200ms] I don't get it. Seriously, I don't!
[514200ms - 515370ms] Let loose?
[515370ms - 517920ms] I wouldn't be in this mess if I could do that!
[518420ms - 519380ms] Old man!
[520130ms - 522340ms] Y-Yeah!
[522340ms - 523090ms] Oh!
[523460ms - 524420ms] Yea—
[528800ms - 530510ms] I-Is he okay?!
[530510ms - 532220ms] He's fine.
[532220ms - 534680ms] He's always like this.
[536730ms - 538390ms] He really let it out, huh?
[539980ms - 541730ms] That was a lot...
[541730ms - 544400ms] Old man, don't disappear into the bottle!
[544400ms - 545900ms] Yeah.
[545900ms - 547610ms] And clean that up!
[547610ms - 548990ms] Yeah...
[551870ms - 552530ms] Here.
[554290ms - 556660ms] Y-Yeah!
[555750ms - 556660ms] Yah.
[557710ms - 559040ms] So?
[559040ms - 561670ms] How's it feel to let loose a little?
[564460ms - 566010ms] Not bad.
[566670ms - 567920ms] Good.
[573350ms - 576180ms] Hey, you getting sleepy at all?
[576180ms - 578180ms] A little, I guess.
[578180ms - 579020ms] Okay.
[580270ms - 582440ms] Let's go to my place, then.
[583610ms - 584400ms] Huh?
[586900ms - 593120ms] I want to give advice to people who can't sleep and help them resolve their issues.
[596040ms - 598540ms] This doesn't look like a smutty joint, at least.
[606130ms - 607840ms] Okay then, lie down.
[609010ms - 610050ms] Uh...
[610050ms - 611340ms] What's this...
[623520ms - 625110ms] Just my bed.
[626070ms - 626980ms] Okay, let's sleep.
[626980ms - 629690ms] A-A-Are you gonna do dirty stuff to me?!
[629690ms - 631900ms] Huh? No, nothing dirty.
[631900ms - 633570ms] Just a guy and a girl, sleeping together.
[633570ms - 634660ms] That's plenty dirty!
[634660ms - 636410ms] Sorry, gotta go 'cuz I'm scared! Toodles!
[636700ms - 638790ms] Not so fast, boy.
[639120ms - 641620ms] Don't worry. I won't do anything.
[641620ms - 642500ms] It's just the tip!
[642500ms - 643710ms] What tip?!
[645880ms - 647170ms] Don't you want to sleep?
[649130ms - 650460ms] Don't worry.
[650460ms - 653840ms] When you wake up, you'll feel super refreshed!
[657810ms - 660850ms] Close your eyes and don't think.
[661730ms - 665400ms] Now slowly, take deep breaths.
[672190ms - 674240ms] What am I doing?
[675280ms - 676950ms] Do I just not care anymore?
[678370ms - 679790ms] Still not sleepy?
[680700ms - 681790ms] Oh, uh!
[682540ms - 683370ms] I'm fine.
[686080ms - 687460ms] What is this?
[687460ms - 690130ms] Anyone can tell she's a nutjob.
[690130ms - 692550ms] So why is this so relaxing?
[693670ms - 695970ms] This is what it feels like to sleep with someone?
[696840ms - 699720ms] She might be a bit weird, but I guess she's nice.
[700810ms - 703270ms] I'll pretend to be asleep for a bit and go home.
[703270ms - 705520ms] I'm really good at pretending I'm asleep.
[715110ms - 715910ms] You asleep?
[720700ms - 722750ms] Wait, are you really asleep?
[723370ms - 724540ms] Hello?
[725330ms - 728210ms] Hey, you're actually awake, right?
[729210ms - 731380ms] Hello? Boy?
[742260ms - 743770ms] Thank goodness.
[743770ms - 746730ms] He's finally asleep.
[748940ms - 752190ms] I can't wait any longer.
[754400ms - 755360ms] Well then.
[757070ms - 759280ms] Time to eat.
[782510ms - 785560ms] Wh-What's with this kid?
[785930ms - 787390ms] He tastes so good!
[789850ms - 791060ms] What was that just now?
[791060ms - 791940ms] Huh?!
[791940ms - 793730ms] Wh-Why're you awake?!
[796820ms - 797700ms] Blood.
[798530ms - 800030ms] Is that mine?
[802870ms - 806200ms] Um... a mosquito...
[806200ms - 808080ms] There was this huge mosquito.
[808080ms - 810170ms] Oh! A mosquito!
[810170ms - 812080ms] I got it with a good slap.
[812080ms - 814130ms] A good slap. Right.
[818760ms - 820760ms] Not very convincing, huh?
[820760ms - 823010ms] Nope, not really.
[823720ms - 824680ms] Sorry.
[824680ms - 826560ms] You have blood on your mouth.
[827850ms - 829100ms] No dice, huh?
[829730ms - 837320ms] So, um... are you, uh, a vampire... of some sort?
[837320ms - 838900ms] Yeah, I suppose I am.
[839530ms - 841160ms] You are, huh?
[842620ms - 847750ms] Then does that mean I'm a vampire now?!
[848870ms - 851250ms] Nah, probably not.
[851250ms - 852540ms] No worries there.
[852540ms - 854790ms] Oh, I'm not?
[857170ms - 861050ms] So why am I not one?
[861050ms - 864470ms] Or more like, why didn't you turn me into one?
[865720ms - 867310ms] What do you mean?
[867310ms - 868640ms] Well, I mean...
[868640ms - 872940ms] Don't vampires suck blood in order to create offspring?
[872940ms - 875650ms] Oh! You mean that kind of thing!
[875650ms - 877150ms] I see!
[877150ms - 879780ms] Yeah, I guess people tend to think that!
[881070ms - 884070ms] To me, sucking blood is like eating.
[884530ms - 885410ms] Eating?
[885740ms - 886660ms] Yeah.
[886660ms - 888040ms] I mean, think about it.
[888540ms - 891540ms] Wouldn't it suck if you made new kids every time you ate?
[891540ms - 893040ms] Yeah, that would suck.
[893040ms - 894330ms] Plus it'd freak me out.
[894330ms - 895540ms] Right?
[895540ms - 898550ms] So basically, it depends.
[898550ms - 902420ms] I hear there are vampires who create loads of offspring,
[902420ms - 904930ms] but I'm not interested in that kind of thing.
[909470ms - 910430ms] So?
[910430ms - 911390ms] Huh?
[911390ms - 913810ms] Don't "Huh?" me.
[913810ms - 916270ms] You never answered my question, you know.
[916270ms - 917650ms] Uh? What was it again?
[917980ms - 923450ms] Like I said, why didn't I turn into a vampire even though you sucked my blood?!
[923450ms - 925740ms] All right, fine. Man, you're loud.
[925740ms - 927200ms] I-I'm loud?!
[927200ms - 929030ms] I'm not being loud!
[929030ms - 933870ms] Y'see, I don't wanna go around telling people this...
[935960ms - 939040ms] The reason you're not a vampire...
[939040ms - 943470ms] Or rather, the way a person can become a vampire...
[944550ms - 948260ms] is for that person to fall in love with one.
[951560ms - 952060ms] Lo—
[952810ms - 954350ms] Oh.
[954350ms - 955310ms] Huh?
[955310ms - 956940ms] Okay, I see.
[957560ms - 958900ms] Fall in love, huh?
[962780ms - 965110ms] Wait, why are you all embarrassed?
[967740ms - 970370ms] Man, my face is burning!
[970370ms - 972240ms] The beer's so good!
[974120ms - 976500ms] Well, anyway, uh...
[976500ms - 984380ms] Basically, when a person who's in love with a vampire gets that vampire to suck their blood, they become their offspring.
[985590ms - 989720ms] Just like how a child results when a man and a woman in love copulate!
[989720ms - 992220ms] Uh, why the gross analogy all of a sudden?
[992510ms - 994020ms] But that's true, right?
[994020ms - 997100ms] Humans can only create offspring through copulation.
[997100ms - 998850ms] S-Stop saying "copulate"!
[998850ms - 1000480ms] Why not? And how old are you, anyway?
[1001820ms - 1002980ms] I'm 14.
[1002980ms - 1005530ms] What?! You're still a little punk!
[1005530ms - 1008740ms] At that age, you should be all over talking about copulation and stuff.
[1008740ms - 1009570ms] What's wrong with you?
[1009570ms - 1012160ms] That's ridiculous! And why do you call it copulation?!
[1012160ms - 1017080ms] And then comes the l-love gossip, and uh... love gossip, right?!
[1017080ms - 1018620ms] Why do you look kinda put off?!
[1018620ms - 1020750ms] How can you lecture me when your cheeks are so red?!
[1020750ms - 1021710ms] Shut up!
[1030590ms - 1032180ms] What can I say?
[1032180ms - 1034430ms] I don't really get all that stuff.
[1035600ms - 1038190ms] Don't you have a crush on anyone at school?
[1038190ms - 1039650ms] No.
[1039650ms - 1040730ms] Though it's more like...
[1041360ms - 1042820ms] I don't like girls.
[1042820ms - 1045280ms] Huh?! You mean you like boys?
[1045280ms - 1047110ms] Nice. I approve.
[1047110ms - 1049110ms] That's not what I mean.
[1049110ms - 1050360ms] Then what do you mean?
[1053080ms - 1054910ms] That's your response?
[1054910ms - 1056330ms] You suck.
[1056700ms - 1058410ms] Shut up, ugly.
[1059000ms - 1061000ms] This is why I hate girls.
[1063500ms - 1065050ms] Okay, I'm off...
[1068670ms - 1069760ms] The hell with this.
[1075060ms - 1077270ms] Junior high can be tough, huh?
[1077270ms - 1081150ms] So you stopped going to school and started fooling around at night.
[1081150ms - 1085070ms] Well, I know I shouldn't be doing this kind of thing.
[1086440ms - 1087990ms] Tell me, boy.
[1087990ms - 1090900ms] How does your first night out feel?
[1090900ms - 1094950ms] What do you think now that you've taken a step outside the norm?
[1096910ms - 1103580ms] This place is the furthest you can hope to get from all that tedious crap during the day.
[1103580ms - 1107380ms] It'd be a waste if you didn't keep this kind of thing up.
[1114930ms - 1116760ms] I was getting by just fine.
[1117510ms - 1118390ms] I think.
[1119020ms - 1121350ms] At least, I tried to do the right thing.
[1122140ms - 1125400ms] Since there was nothing I wanted to do or to be.
[1126690ms - 1128320ms] Who cares?
[1128320ms - 1130320ms] School's boring, right?
[1132990ms - 1136620ms] Stay up until you feel satisfied about your day.
[1137280ms - 1139950ms] That's not a bad way to live.
[1142660ms - 1144460ms] So yeah, do me a favor and—
[1144460ms - 1145250ms] Ms. Vampire!
[1145250ms - 1146790ms] Huh? Y-Yeah?!
[1146790ms - 1147630ms] I have a favor to ask!
[1149590ms - 1152670ms] Turn me into a vampire!
[1155890ms - 1157800ms] H-Hold up a sec.
[1157800ms - 1158930ms] What is it?
[1158930ms - 1163640ms] L-Like I said, a person has to fulfill specific conditions in order to become a vampire...
[1163640ms - 1164940ms] I know that!
[1164940ms - 1167060ms] They need to fall in love with a vampire.
[1165560ms - 1167980ms] Hey! Stop that! It's embarrassing!
[1168400ms - 1170940ms] I'd probably never take that leap.
[1171440ms - 1175860ms] I know I'll just go back to my old life and spend my days in boredom.
[1176700ms - 1179530ms] But now I've seen the night.
[1180290ms - 1182290ms] It's the first time I've wanted to be something.
[1182750ms - 1184500ms] I don't want to lose this feeling!
[1184830ms - 1187960ms] So please, let me fall in love with you!
[1192590ms - 1194470ms] You say the darndest things, you know that?
[1195090ms - 1197800ms] It's my policy to not create offspring.
[1199050ms - 1203480ms] Just so you know, I'm not gonna do anything.
[1203480ms - 1206400ms] I'm just gonna suck your blood like the vampire that I am.
[1206400ms - 1207980ms] If you wanna fall in love, be my guest.
[1210440ms - 1212030ms] I'm Nanakusa Nazuna, by the way.
[1212030ms - 1212650ms] You?
[1214030ms - 1215530ms] Yamori Kou.
[1218240ms - 1222240ms] Do you know when human blood tastes best?
[1222240ms - 1223040ms] Huh?
[1223040ms - 1224410ms] At night.
[1224410ms - 1228960ms] Especially right before a person falls asleep up until the moment that they actually do.
[1228960ms - 1232420ms] That's because the blood is infused with night.
[1233260ms - 1235550ms] Um, why the roof?
[1236050ms - 1238840ms] To be closer to the moon, obviously.
[1238840ms - 1239800ms] What?
[1239800ms - 1245310ms] If you think about the distance to the moon, climbing a building is pretty negligible.
[1245310ms - 1250310ms] That's why I want to infuse more night in you, boy.
[1250310ms - 1252520ms] You mean I need to stay up late?
[1252520ms - 1254780ms] Well, I plan on that anyway.
[1255150ms - 1259490ms] That too, of course, but in order to infuse blood with night—
[1259490ms - 1261410ms] in other words, to stay up late—
[1261410ms - 1264540ms] you have to do more than just stay awake.
[1264540ms - 1266330ms] But you wouldn't know what I mean.
[1267080ms - 1267540ms] Huh?
[1268620ms - 1272750ms] So I'll teach you what it means to enjoy the night.
[1274880ms - 1275590ms] I'm gonna die!
[1275590ms - 1276210ms] No, you won't.
[1283140ms - 1285350ms] The night is for fooling around.
[1285350ms - 1287480ms] Let's have some fun, boy.
[1289310ms - 1291150ms] Hang on tight.
[1339900ms - 1341910ms] What do you think, boy?
[1341910ms - 1343530ms] How do you feel?
[1360970ms - 1362590ms] Awesome.
[1363550ms - 1364550ms] Isn't it?
