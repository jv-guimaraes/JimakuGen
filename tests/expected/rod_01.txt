[13210ms - 15380ms] Please watch your step, Mr. President.
[16260ms - 16710ms] Freeze!!
[16840ms - 18680ms] Hands up and turn around!!
[29350ms - 30100ms] Shoot him!!
[56960ms - 57550ms] Hey!
[58550ms - 61130ms] Isn't this the Library?
[61760ms - 63050ms] No, it isn't...!
[65970ms - 66850ms] Blockheads.
[70640ms - 73190ms] Oh well... then I'll go on foot.
[73980ms - 75520ms] What are you?!
[78610ms - 79320ms] I-jin.
[185840ms - 186720ms] Hello...
[187720ms - 189430ms] This is Readman.
[190140ms - 192100ms] Yes, Yomiko Readman...
[193100ms - 194850ms] Yes, I am.
[196230ms - 197520ms] Yes!
[198400ms - 199900ms] Yes, I'm totally free!
[200440ms - 202480ms] Yes, that's fine.
[203230ms - 204490ms] You can count on me!
[205820ms - 206950ms] Just a moment please.
[218540ms - 219630ms] Yes, go ahead.
[220590ms - 221000ms] Yes...
[222090ms - 223000ms] Yes!
[223590ms - 225170ms] Yes, the twelfth, next week.
[225880ms - 227590ms] OK, the week after.
[228260ms - 232890ms] Not at all, thank you! Thank you very much!
[236430ms - 238940ms] I did it!
[374860ms - 376600ms] Note: "Immortal Beloved", the addressee of a love letter which composer Ludwig van Beethoven wrote in July 1812.
[390170ms - 392130ms] Wait, don't take that.
[392420ms - 393550ms] Why?
[393930ms - 395430ms] I was going to buy that book.
[396300ms - 399310ms] But I'm the one who picked it up.
[400510ms - 401470ms] Well, then.
[415950ms - 416910ms] Can I get this?
[417110ms - 417950ms] 3500 Yen.
[421240ms - 424290ms] Ah... I'm sorry, but could I pay at the end of the month?
[431460ms - 432960ms] Immortal Beloved...
[469460ms - 471290ms] What? What is this?!
[475880ms - 477340ms] Bugs? What is this?!
[520890ms - 522890ms] I'll take that book!
[535360ms - 536070ms] Unmistakable.
[554590ms - 555880ms] What happened?
[562430ms - 564430ms] Please give my book back!
[569640ms - 571850ms] I just started reading that!
[575360ms - 576360ms] Give it back!
[597250ms - 598340ms] Am I too late!?
[605180ms - 605970ms] Yomiko!
[607560ms - 608640ms] Joker??
[609600ms - 611180ms] Yomiko! Why are you here?
[611430ms - 613520ms] You too Joker!? Why are you here??
[616270ms - 618190ms] I see. It was you.
[618820ms - 624160ms] What in the world was that?
[624410ms - 625780ms] I'll explain later.
[626240ms - 629990ms] Yomiko... I mean, The Paper, come with me.
[633080ms - 634250ms] Let me borrow that for a moment.
[635790ms - 637210ms] I haven't read it yet!
[637420ms - 639380ms] I'll return it after it's analyzed.
[639550ms - 641880ms] What is it really? Geez!
[642260ms - 643380ms] The world is in danger.
[670030ms - 671450ms] Hi, Joker. That was fast.
[671660ms - 672370ms] Paul.
[672540ms - 674290ms] Please take a look at this immediately.
[674580ms - 675120ms] OK.
[680840ms - 684840ms] You shine brightest when surrounded by books.
[685300ms - 686630ms] Do... do I?
[687220ms - 690180ms] But, evidently you need improvement in all other areas.
[694140ms - 695680ms] Gentleman is waiting for you.
[700400ms - 703320ms] Mr. Gentleman, I've brought The Paper.
[703780ms - 704900ms] Yomiko, eh?
[706740ms - 708160ms] It's been a long time.
[708950ms - 710660ms] You grew up.
[711870ms - 714080ms] Please allow me to bring you up to speed.
[714330ms - 715120ms] Very well...
[716370ms - 716870ms] Well then.
[719670ms - 720500ms] Two days ago...
[720630ms - 723090ms] a mystery man appeared in Washington DC.
[723920ms - 725590ms] He caused tremendous damage...
[725760ms - 728630ms] eventually attacking the United States Library of Congress.
[729180ms - 732970ms] He stole six hundred manuscripts and disappeared.
[733350ms - 734430ms] Manuscripts?
[734810ms - 735600ms] Yes.
[736640ms - 740600ms] We have received a formal request from the US Library of Congress.
[741270ms - 744610ms] It's for capturing the offender and returning the manuscripts.
[745400ms - 748950ms] However, this case has bizarre elements.
[750240ms - 753370ms] Concerning this footage of the mystery man...
[753700ms - 755910ms] In other words... It's about this...
[756250ms - 760000ms] The Elekiter, made by a Japanese inventor named Gennai Hiraga.
[760500ms - 761290ms] Which is to say...
[761460ms - 763920ms] there's the possibility that the mystery man is Hiraga Gennai.
[764210ms - 767550ms] But Hiraga Gennai died years ago.
[768510ms - 770010ms] Precisely...
[773680ms - 776930ms] A year ago, stem-cell samples of I-jin were stolen...
[777100ms - 779440ms] from the Department of Dominant Gene Conservation.
[779850ms - 783310ms] Hiraga Gennai's name is on this list of stolen DNA.
[784650ms - 788280ms] Someone may have used this DNA to bring Gennai back to life...
[789030ms - 791950ms] with dreadful special abilities.
[792280ms - 793570ms] For what purpose?
[795160ms - 796160ms] Unknown.
[802830ms - 804960ms] The entry in the grasshopper guy's note book...
[805460ms - 807500ms] corresponds to Fabre's "Book of insects".
[807670ms - 810670ms] That man is a clone of Jean-Henri Fabre.
[811720ms - 813800ms] Why did Fabre attack me?
[814050ms - 816810ms] You were not his target, the book was.
[817510ms - 818520ms] This is the first of two books.
[819140ms - 821520ms] The second book was among the stolen manuscripts.
[822600ms - 827270ms] Gentleman, someone has concocted an evil plot utilizing I-jin DNA.
[828190ms - 830780ms] Please devise an official operation to settle this business.
[831700ms - 832530ms] All right.
[832950ms - 834240ms] Thank you very much.
[834780ms - 837830ms] Now, the British Library Special Engineer Force...
[837910ms - 841000ms] shall commence "Operation Manuscript Retrieval."
[841410ms - 845080ms] Excuse me, am I part of this, too?
[845290ms - 846500ms] Of course you are.
[847710ms - 849630ms] I... I have a substitute-teaching job...
[849710ms - 851720ms] as a maternity leave replacement starting next week.
[853180ms - 856100ms] Which do you think is more important? World peace or maternity leave?
[856300ms - 861520ms] But... but, even if the world was at peace, without a job, I wouldn't be happy at all!
[861930ms - 863440ms] We'll pay for your services.
[863640ms - 864560ms] It's not enough!
[865020ms - 867110ms] I've been buying so many books this month.
[867650ms - 869230ms] Oh, and I have an unpaid balance on that book, also!
[874570ms - 875990ms] You haven't changed.
[876530ms - 878990ms] You're impetuous as usual.
[880620ms - 885210ms] OK, I'll give you the second volume of that stolen book as an extra reward.
[885580ms - 886380ms] Really?
[886880ms - 887580ms] Yes.
[888090ms - 889380ms] I... I'll try my best!
[889550ms - 890750ms] Are you sure about that?
[891000ms - 892920ms] I can fake it.
[898350ms - 899430ms] What is it?
[900060ms - 900970ms] The book...
[901600ms - 903100ms] Analysis first.
[908190ms - 908770ms] Gentleman.
[909230ms - 912610ms] I would like to have a support staff and one more agent.
[912940ms - 913990ms] Very well.
[932170ms - 933630ms] Drake Anderson speaking.
[948980ms - 951770ms] Now listen here! I picked a paper fortune this morning!
[952320ms - 954490ms] It said "Great Fortune". You know, that's big time lucky!
[955110ms - 956740ms] But half way through the day...
[956950ms - 961240ms] stupid Joker called me and told me to support you!
[962030ms - 963950ms] If "Great Fortune" gives me a day like this...
[964160ms - 966290ms] what kind of disaster would it have been if I picked a bad fortune?
[972540ms - 974510ms] Ah... Drake!
[975210ms - 976300ms] It's a mission! Get down!
[976590ms - 977720ms] Oh... yes!
[988020ms - 989850ms] Mister Anderson, over here.
[990020ms - 990980ms] Poor thing...
[992270ms - 992940ms] What's wrong?
[993190ms - 995030ms] The damage to this wall is odd.
[995360ms - 998820ms] There's no residue of any explosive or fire damage either.
[999660ms - 1003490ms] Has the other agent arrived?
[1003830ms - 1004790ms] I don't know.
[1005040ms - 1005490ms] And?
[1005620ms - 1005990ms] Yes.
[1006790ms - 1009620ms] What should I do now?
[1009830ms - 1011580ms] Just don't bother anybody.
[1011750ms - 1013840ms] Go to a corner to sit and daydream or something.
[1014670ms - 1015750ms] What do you mean?
[1016090ms - 1018920ms] This room appears to have become a microwave.
[1019090ms - 1020340ms] Is it an Optical weapon?
[1023640ms - 1025010ms] Corner... corner...
[1029600ms - 1031850ms] Von Arnim's "Letters to the Assembly"!
[1034190ms - 1036780ms] This one is Pincinelli's "Mundus Symbolicus"!
[1048250ms - 1050910ms] "Gustav Flaubert" is just sitting here.
[1057420ms - 1058130ms] You're...!
[1059260ms - 1061380ms] We meet again, The Paper.
[1063840ms - 1065470ms] Then, it's you!
[1065600ms - 1066930ms] I'm Miss Deep.
[1067430ms - 1068270ms] Deep?
[1069020ms - 1070890ms] I've been hearing rumors about you.
[1071310ms - 1073480ms] Though I was not expecting to see you in Tokyo.
[1074730ms - 1076360ms] So you're after this book, too?
[1076610ms - 1081490ms] It was an order from Joker. But I didn't think you were The Paper.
[1083360ms - 1085700ms] I'm Yomiko, Yomiko Readman.
[1086030ms - 1086830ms] I see.
[1094500ms - 1096460ms] What's your name?
[1096750ms - 1098920ms] I told you, I'm Miss Deep.
[1099250ms - 1100210ms] Your real name?
[1100460ms - 1103340ms] Are there any agents that give their real names at a first meeting?
[1104220ms - 1104680ms] Yeah...
[1104930ms - 1106550ms] Your awareness is insufficient.
[1106970ms - 1110600ms] But, won't we get along better calling each other by name?
[1111890ms - 1115940ms] We pair up for the mission. Codenames are enough.
[1116480ms - 1117610ms] I see...
[1118400ms - 1120480ms] Well, nice to meet you for now.
[1122280ms - 1122650ms] Yes!
[1125490ms - 1125950ms] Huh?
[1136170ms - 1138090ms] This is my power.
[1138380ms - 1140710ms] I can dive deeply into substances and pass through them.
[1140880ms - 1141920ms] That's why I am Deep.
[1143880ms - 1147340ms] You leave yourself wide open. The Paper is no big threat.
[1154810ms - 1156480ms] I'm sorry... I was...
[1157480ms - 1159020ms] My glasses are...
[1160190ms - 1161730ms] So you do have some skills.
[1162360ms - 1162860ms] Huh?
[1168240ms - 1169990ms] I am Otto Lilienthal!
[1170530ms - 1172040ms] I'll take that book!
[1172330ms - 1172910ms] What?!
[1190930ms - 1193010ms] A bullet can't kill the wind!
[1193310ms - 1194810ms] You can never kill the wind!
[1210280ms - 1211070ms] What a bad day...
[1211160ms - 1212490ms] Drake!
[1213490ms - 1215330ms] He took the book!
[1216000ms - 1216870ms] Huh?
[1219750ms - 1220750ms] I'll go after him!
[1221250ms - 1223340ms] The enemy was one of the I-jin, report it!
[1224760ms - 1225590ms] Who is this?
[1225880ms - 1227220ms] Oh, my partner...
[1227420ms - 1228590ms] Miss Deep.
[1231470ms - 1232800ms] What's your fortune today?
[1233470ms - 1234060ms] Huh?
[1240600ms - 1243480ms] Malone from the FBI. Connect me to the Pentagon.
[1248780ms - 1249700ms] Come in.
[1250360ms - 1252070ms] I brought the data.
[1253490ms - 1255120ms] I-jin have been spotted!
[1255410ms - 1257370ms] This one's name is "Otto Lilienthal".
[1257950ms - 1259540ms] Who is that?
[1260830ms - 1263420ms] He was called, "the Aerial King of Germany".
[1264000ms - 1265300ms] Mister Gentleman?!
[1265800ms - 1268550ms] An obscure genius during the glider generation.
[1269220ms - 1271380ms] That genius is heading to New York.
[1272300ms - 1273720ms] At phenomenal speed!
[1279310ms - 1283940ms] Echo 1, 2, 3. We spotted the target, an unidentified flying object.
[1284690ms - 1285690ms] Shoot him down!
[1290070ms - 1292240ms] They're flying such pedestrian crafts.
[1307130ms - 1309090ms] Still one left, eh?
[1319850ms - 1322140ms] Echo 1, 2 and 3 shot down.
[1322690ms - 1324810ms] The US army is having a hard time.
[1325360ms - 1327230ms] You can't fight him conventionally.
[1327520ms - 1328650ms] My book...
[1328940ms - 1329940ms] My book...
[1330400ms - 1332320ms] All units converge on target.
[1332950ms - 1336320ms] All units, prepare for battle! Fire as soon as you have a visual.
[1337950ms - 1339080ms] A Samurai?!
[1353840ms - 1355510ms] All... destroyed!
[1363440ms - 1364640ms] Bail out!
[1386750ms - 1388840ms] What can we do? We can't catch him on foot.
[1389090ms - 1391420ms] I know. But there must be some way...
[1392590ms - 1394090ms] There is a way!
[1413030ms - 1414570ms] You're going after him in that? Seriously?
[1414780ms - 1415610ms] Unbelievable...
[1416150ms - 1416950ms] Hurry!
[1419320ms - 1420280ms] Take this.
[1421870ms - 1423620ms] I've never had a mission like this.
[1426670ms - 1428040ms] Don't blame me if you fall off!
[1428290ms - 1429130ms] I'll blame you!
[1429880ms - 1430500ms] Three...
[1431170ms - 1431960ms] Two...
[1432300ms - 1433050ms] One...
[1433800ms - 1435630ms] Fire!!
[1442140ms - 1443890ms] That woman is misfortune.
[1444310ms - 1445640ms] Hey! What's going on?
[1445770ms - 1447770ms] Sorry! I forgot the tail assembly!
[1451610ms - 1453070ms] Successful takeoff!
[1453480ms - 1455280ms] I thought it was falling.
[1464120ms - 1465870ms] It's about time to go back... mm?
[1488060ms - 1489850ms] Please give my book back!
[1491480ms - 1493230ms] Land slowly, now!
[1493900ms - 1494940ms] Don't underestimate me!
[1495530ms - 1498650ms] I'll show you why I was called "The Aerial King"!
[1503490ms - 1506580ms] Flying in that thing! How shameless!
[1506750ms - 1507790ms] This is ridiculous!
[1508000ms - 1509080ms] He's up to something!
[1514500ms - 1515710ms] Spin! Spin!!
[1515800ms - 1516670ms] Crash!!
[1516840ms - 1517840ms] Hold on!
[1532650ms - 1533560ms] This sucks!
[1533940ms - 1534770ms] I am not happy!
[1535270ms - 1537780ms] Ms. Deep! I'm changing tactics!
[1548240ms - 1549370ms] Ok, I'm going.
[1549620ms - 1550620ms] Please!
[1573020ms - 1574060ms] Fall! Fall!
[1574770ms - 1576060ms] Eat some dust!
[1581900ms - 1583360ms] You...!
[1583740ms - 1584740ms] Witch!!
[1585280ms - 1587660ms] If you're a witch you should fly with a broom.
[1591790ms - 1593000ms] What?!
[1596580ms - 1599090ms] My book. Please give it back!
[1601970ms - 1603220ms] Give it back to me!
[1603630ms - 1605010ms] You...!!
[1622400ms - 1623820ms] Paper...
[1625990ms - 1626570ms] The book...
[1644010ms - 1645300ms] Die! Die!
[1655190ms - 1657690ms] Your sky comes to a dead end here.
[1658270ms - 1661020ms] Die!!
[1666150ms - 1668360ms] Die!!
[1670370ms - 1671330ms] The book!
[1700650ms - 1702150ms] You're an idiot, aren't you?
[1703440ms - 1705490ms] Don't you ever think about the consequences?
[1705940ms - 1707860ms] Is that book more important than your life?
[1711530ms - 1714740ms] But at least you're not a useless idiot, after all.
